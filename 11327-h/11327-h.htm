<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<br>
<p>The intention of this book is to lay stress on ideas and
tendencies that have to be understood and appreciated, rather than
on facts that have to be learned by heart. Many authors are not
mentioned and others receive scanty treatment, because of the
necessities of this method of approach. The book aims at dealing
with the matter of authors more than with their lives; consequently
it contains few dates. All that the reader need require to help him
have been included in a short chronological table at the end.</p>
<p>To have attempted a severely ordered and analytic treatment of
the subject would have been, for the author at least, impossible
within the limits imposed, and, in any case, would have been
foreign to the purpose indicated by the editors of the Home
University Library. The book pretends no more than to be a general
introduction to a very great subject, and it will have fulfilled
all that is intended for it if it stimulates those who read it to
set about reading for themselves the books of which it treats.</p>
<p>Its debts are many, its chief creditors two teachers, Professor
Grierson at Aberdeen University and Sir Walter Raleigh at Oxford,
to the stimulation of whose books and teaching my pleasure in
English literature and any understanding I have of it are due. To
them and to the other writers (chief of them Professor Herford)
whose ideas I have wittingly or unwittingly incorporated in it, as
well as to the kindness and patience of Professor Gilbert Murray, I
wish here to express my indebtedness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<br>
<h3>THE RENAISSANCE</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>There are times in every man's experience when some sudden
widening of the boundaries of his knowledge, some vision of
hitherto untried and unrealized possibilities, has come and seemed
to bring with it new life and the inspiration of fresh and splendid
endeavour. It may be some great book read for the first time not as
a book, but as a revelation; it may be the first realization of the
extent and moment of what physical science has to teach us; it may
be, like Carlyle's "Everlasting Yea," an ethical illumination, or
spiritual like Augustine's or John Wesley's. But whatever it is, it
brings with it new eyes, new powers of comprehension, and seems to
reveal a treasury of latent and unsuspected talents in the mind and
heart. The history of mankind has its parallels to these moments of
illumination in the life of the individual. There are times when
the boundaries of human experience, always narrow, and fluctuating
but little between age and age, suddenly widen themselves, and the
spirit of man leaps forward to possess and explore its new domain.
These are the great ages of the world. They could be counted,
perhaps, on one hand. The age of Pericles in Athens; the less
defined age, when Europe passed, spiritually and artistically, from
what we call the Dark, to what we call the Middle Ages; the
Renaissance; the period of the French Revolution. Two of them, so
far as English literature is concerned, fall within the compass of
this book, and it is with one of them&mdash;the
Renaissance&mdash;that it begins.</p>
<p>It is as difficult to find a comprehensive formula for what the
Renaissance meant as to tie it down to a date. The year 1453 A.D.,
when the Eastern Empire&mdash;the last relic of the continuous
spirit of Rome&mdash;fell before the Turks, used to be given as the
date, and perhaps the word "Renaissance" itself&mdash;"a new
birth"&mdash;is as much as can be accomplished shortly by way of
definition. Michelet's resonant "discovery by mankind of himself
and of the world" rather expresses what a man of the Renaissance
himself must have thought it, than what we in this age can declare
it to be. But both endeavours to date and to define are alike
impossible. One cannot fix a term to day or night, and the theory
of the Renaissance as a kind of tropical dawn&mdash;a sudden
passage to light from darkness&mdash;is not to be considered. The
Renaissance was, and was the result of, a numerous and various
series of events which followed and accompanied one another from
the fourteenth to the beginning of the sixteenth centuries. First
and most immediate in its influence on art and literature and
thought, was the rediscovery of the ancient literatures. In the
Middle Ages knowledge of Greek and Latin literatures had withdrawn
itself into monasteries, and there narrowed till of secular Latin
writing scarcely any knowledge remained save of Vergil (because of
his supposed Messianic prophecy) and Statius, and of Greek, except
Aristotle, none at all. What had been lost in the Western Empire,
however, subsisted in the East, and the continual advance of the
Turk on the territories of the Emperors of Constantinople drove
westward to the shelter of Italy and the Church, and to the
patronage of the Medicis, a crowd of scholars who brought with them
their manuscripts of Homer and the dramatists, of Thucydides and
Herodotus, and most momentous perhaps for the age to come, of Plato
and Demosthenes and of the New Testament in its original Greek. The
quick and vivid intellect of Italy, which had been torpid in the
decadence of mediaevalism and its mysticism and piety, seized with
avidity the revelation of the classical world which the scholars
and their manuscripts brought. Human life, which the mediaeval
Church had taught them to regard but as a threshold and
stepping-stone to eternity, acquired suddenly a new momentousness
and value; the promises of the Church paled like its lamps at
sunrise; and a new paganism, which had Plato for its high priest,
and Demosthenes and Pericles for its archetypes and examples, ran
like wild-fire through Italy. The Greek spirit seized on art, and
produced Raphael, Leonardo, and Michel Angelo; on literature and
philosophy and gave us Pico della Mirandula, on life and gave us
the Medicis and Castiglione and Machiavelli. Then&mdash;the
invention not of Italy but of Germany&mdash;came the art of
printing, and made this revival of Greek literature quickly
portable into other lands.</p>
<p>Even more momentous was the new knowledge the age brought of the
physical world. The brilliant conjectures of Copernicus paved the
way for Galileo, and the warped and narrow cosmology which
conceived the earth as the centre of the universe, suffered a blow
that in shaking it shook also religion. And while the conjectures
of the men of science were adding regions undreamt of to the
physical universe, the discoverers were enlarging the territories
of the earth itself. The Portuguese, with the aid of sailors
trained in the great Mediterranean ports of Genoa and Venice,
pushed the track of exploration down the western coast of Africa;
the Cape was circumnavigated by Vasco da Gama, and India reached
for the first time by Western men by way of the sea. Columbus
reached Trinidad and discovered the "New" World; his successors
pushed past him and touched the Continent. Spanish colonies grew up
along the coasts of North and Central America and in Peru, and the
Portuguese reached Brazil. Cabot and the English voyagers reached
Newfoundland and Labrador; the French made their way up the St.
Lawrence. The discovery of the gold mines brought new and
unimagined possibilities of wealth to the Old World, while the
imagination of Europe, bounded since the beginning of recorded time
by the Western ocean, and with the Mediterranean as its centre,
shot out to the romance and mystery of untried seas.</p>
<p>It is difficult for us in these later days to conceive the
profound and stirring influence of such an alteration on thought
and literature. To the men at the end of the fifteenth century
scarcely a year but brought another bit of received and recognized
thinking to the scrap-heap; scarcely a year but some new discovery
found itself surpassed and in its turn discarded, or lessened in
significance by something still more new. Columbus sailed westward
to find a new sea route, and as he imagined, a more expeditious one
to "the Indies"; the name West Indies still survives to show the
theory on which the early discoverers worked. The rapidity with
which knowledge widened can be gathered by a comparison of the maps
of the day. In the earlier of them the mythical Brazil, a relic
perhaps of the lost Atlantis, lay a regularly and mystically blue
island off the west coast of Ireland; then the Azores were
discovered and the name fastened on to one of the islands of that
archipelago. Then Amerigo reached South America and the name became
finally fixed to the country that we know. There is nothing
nowadays that can give us a parallel to the stirring and exaltation
of the imagination which intoxicated the men of the Renaissance,
and gave a new birth to thought and art. The great scientific
discoveries of the nineteenth century came to men more prepared for
the shock of new surprises, and they carried evidence less tangible
and indisputable to the senses. Perhaps if the strivings of science
should succeed in proving as evident and comprehensible the
existences which spiritualist and psychical research is striving to
establish, we should know the thrill that the great twin
discoverers, Copernicus and Columbus, brought to Europe.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>This rough sketch of the Renaissance has been set down because
it is only by realizing the period in its largest and broadest
sense that we can understand the beginnings of our own modern
literature. The Renaissance reached England late. By the time that
the impulse was at its height with Spenser and Shakespeare, it had
died out in Italy, and in France to which in its turn Italy had
passed the torch, it was already a waning fire. When it came to
England it came in a special form shaped by political and social
conditions, and by the accidents of temperament and inclination in
the men who began the movement. But the essence of the inspiration
remained the same as it had been on the Continent, and the twin
threads of its two main impulses, the impulse from the study of the
classics, and the impulse given to men's minds by the voyages of
discovery, runs through all the texture of our Renaissance
literature.</p>
<p>Literature as it developed in the reign of Elizabeth ran counter
to the hopes and desires of the men who began the movement; the
common usage which extends the term Elizabethan backwards outside
the limits of the reign itself, has nothing but its carelessness to
recommend it. The men of the early renaissance in the reigns of
Edward VI. and Mary, belonged to a graver school than their
successors. They were no splendid courtiers, nor daring and hardy
adventurers, still less swashbucklers, exquisites, or literary
dandies. Their names&mdash;Sir John Cheke, Roger Ascham, Nicholas
Udall, Thomas Wilson, Walter Haddon, belong rather to the
universities and to the coteries of learning, than to the court. To
the nobility, from whose essays and <em>belles lettres</em>
Elizabethan poetry was to develop, they stood in the relation of
tutors rather than of companions, suspecting the extravagances of
their pupils rather than sympathising with their ideals. They were
a band of serious and dignified scholars, men preoccupied with
morality and good-citizenship, and holding those as worth more than
the lighter interests of learning and style. It is perhaps
characteristic of the English temper that the revival of the
classical tongues, which in Italy made for paganism, and the
pursuit of pleasure in life and art, in England brought with it in
the first place a new seriousness and gravity of life, and in
religion the Reformation. But in a way the scholars fought against
tendencies in their age, which were both too fast and too strong
for them. At a time when young men were writing poetry modelled on
the delicate and extravagant verse of Italy, were reading Italian
novels, and affecting Italian fashions in speech and dress, they
were fighting for sound education, for good classical scholarship,
for the purity of native English, and behind all these for the
native strength and worth of the English character, which they felt
to be endangered by orgies of reckless assimilation from abroad.
The revival of the classics at Oxford and Cambridge could not
produce an Erasmus or a Scaliger; we have no fine critical
scholarship of this age to put beside that of Holland or France.
Sir John Cheke and his followers felt they had a public and
national duty to perform, and their knowledge of the classics only
served them for examples of high living and morality, on which
education, in its sense of the formation of character, could be
based.</p>
<p>The literary influence of the revival of letters in England,
apart from its moral influence, took two contradictory and opposing
forms. In the curricula of schools, logic, which in the Middle Ages
had been the groundwork of thought and letters, gave place to
rhetoric. The reading of the ancients awakened new delight in the
melody and beauty of language: men became intoxicated with words.
The practice of rhetoric was universal and it quickly coloured all
literature. It was the habit of the rhetoricians to choose some
subject for declamation and round it to encourage their pupils to
set embellishments and decorations, which commonly proceeded rather
from a delight in language for language's sake, than from any
effect in enforcing an argument. Their models for these exercises
can be traced in their influence on later writers. One of the most
popular of them, Erasmus's "Discourse Persuading a Young Man to
Marriage," which was translated in an English text-book of
rhetoric, reminds one of the first part of Shakespeare's sonnets.
The literary affectation called euphuism was directly based on the
precepts of the handbooks on rhetoric; its author, John Lyly, only
elaborated and made more precise tricks of phrase and writing,
which had been used as exercises in the schools of his youth. The
prose of his school, with its fantastic delight in exuberance of
figure and sound, owed its inspiration, in its form ultimately to
Cicero, and in the decorations with which it was embellished, to
the elder Pliny and later writers of his kind. The long declamatory
speeches and the sententiousness of the early drama were directly
modelled on Seneca, through whom was faintly reflected the tragedy
of Greece, unknown directly or almost unknown to English readers.
Latinism, like every new craze, became a passion, and ran through
the less intelligent kinds of writing in a wild excess. Not much of
the literature of this time remains in common knowledge, and for
examples of these affectations one must turn over the black letter
pages of forgotten books. There high-sounding and familiar words
are handled and bandied about with delight, and you can see in
volume after volume these minor and forgotten authors gloating over
the new found treasure which placed them in their time in the van
of literary success. That they are obsolete now, and indeed were
obsolete before they were dead, is a warning to authors who intend
similar extravagances. Strangeness and exoticism are not lasting
wares. By the time of "Love's Labour Lost" they had become nothing
more than matter for laughter, and it is only through their
reflection and distortion in Shakespeare's pages that we know them
now.</p>
<p>Had not a restraining influence, anxiously and even
acrimoniously urged, broken in on their endeavours the English
language to-day might have been almost as completely latinized as
Spanish or Italian. That the essential Saxon purity of our tongue
has been preserved is to the credit not of sensible unlettered
people eschewing new fashions they could not comprehend, but to the
scholars themselves. The chief service that Cheke and Ascham and
their fellows rendered to English literature was their crusade
against the exaggerated latinity that they had themselves helped to
make possible, the crusade against what they called "inkhorn
terms." "I am of this opinion," said Cheke in a prefatory letter to
a book translated by a friend of his, "that our own tongue should
be written clean and pure, unmixed and unmangled with the borrowing
of other tongues, wherein if we take not heed by time, ever
borrowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as
bankrupt." Writings in the Saxon vernacular like the sermons of
Latimer, who was careful to use nothing not familiar to the common
people, did much to help the scholars to save our prose from the
extravagances which they dreaded. Their attack was directed no less
against the revival of really obsolete words. It is a paradox worth
noting for its strangeness that the first revival of mediaevalism
in modern English literature was in the Renaissance itself. Talking
in studious archaism seems to have been a fashionable practice in
society and court circles. "The fine courtier," says Thomas Wilson
in his <cite>Art of Rhetoric</cite>, "will talk nothing but
Chaucer." The scholars of the English Renaissance fought not only
against the ignorant adoption of their importations, but against
the renewal of forgotten habits of speech.</p>
<p>Their efforts failed, and their ideals had to wait for their
acceptance till the age of Dryden, when Shakespeare and Spenser and
Milton, all of them authors who consistently violated the standards
of Cheke, had done their work. The fine courtier who would talk
nothing but Chaucer was in Elizabeth's reign the saving of English
verse. The beauty and richness of Spenser is based directly on
words he got from <cite>Troilus and Cressida</cite> and the
<cite>Canterbury Tales</cite>. Some of the most sonorous and
beautiful lines in Shakespeare break every canon laid down by the
humanists.</p>
<div class="poem">"Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To his confine"</span></div>
<br>
is a line, three of the chief words of which are Latin importations
that come unfamiliarly, bearing their original interpretation with
them. Milton is packed with similar things: he will talk of a
crowded meeting as "frequent" and use constructions which are
unintelligible to anyone who does not possess a knowledge&mdash;and
a good knowledge&mdash;of Latin syntax. Yet the effect is a good
poetic effect. In attacking latinisms in the language borrowed from
older poets Cheke and his companions were attacking the two chief
sources of Elizabethan poetic vocabulary. All the sonorousness,
beauty and dignity of the poetry and the drama which followed them
would have been lost had they succeeded in their object, and their
verse would have been constrained into the warped and ugly forms of
Sternhold and Hopkins, and those with them who composed the first
and worst metrical version of the Psalms. When their idea
reappeared for its fulfilment phantasy and imagery had temporarily
worn themselves out, and the richer language made simplicity
possible and adequate for poetry.<br>
<br>
<p>There are other directions in which the classical revival
influenced writing that need not detain us here. The attempt to
transplant classical metres into English verse which was the
concern of a little group of authors who called themselves the
Areopagus came to no more success than a similar and contemporary
attempt did in France. An earlier and more lasting result of the
influence of the classics on new ways of thinking is the
<cite>Utopia</cite> of Sir Thomas More, based on Plato's
<cite>Republic</cite>, and followed by similar attempts on the part
of other authors, of which the most notable are Harrington's
<cite>Oceana</cite> and Bacon's <cite>New Atlantis</cite>. In one
way or another the rediscovery of Plato proved the most valuable
part of the Renaissance's gift from Greece. The doctrines of the
Symposium coloured in Italy the writings of Castiglione and
Mirandula. In England they gave us Spenser's "Hymn to Intellectual
Beauty," and they affected, each in his own way, Sir Philip Sidney,
and others of the circle of court writers of his time. More's book
was written in Latin, though there is an English translation almost
contemporary. He combines in himself the two strains that we found
working in the Renaissance, for besides its origin in Plato,
<cite>Utopia</cite> owes not a little to the influence of the
voyages of discovery. In 1507 there was published a little book
called an <cite>Introduction to Cosmography</cite>, which gave an
account of the four voyages of Amerigo. In the story of the fourth
voyage it is narrated that twenty-four men were left in a fort near
Cape Bahia. More used this detail as a starting-point, and one of
the men whom Amerigo left tells the story of this "Nowhere," a
republic partly resembling England but most of all the ideal world
of Plato. Partly resembling England, because no man can escape from
the influences of his own time, whatever road he takes, whether the
road of imagination or any other. His imagination can only build
out of the materials afforded him by his own experience: he can
alter, he can rearrange, but he cannot in the strictest sense of
the word create, and every city of dreams is only the scheme of
things as they are remoulded nearer to the desire of a man's heart.
In a way More has less invention than some of his subtler
followers, but his book is interesting because it is the first
example of a kind of writing which has been attractive to many men
since his time, and particularly to writers of our own day.</p>
<p>There remains one circumstance in the revival of the classics
which had a marked and continuous influence on the literary age
that followed. To get the classics English scholars had as we have
seen to go to Italy. Cheke went there and so did Wilson, and the
path of travel across France and through Lombardy to Florence and
Rome was worn hard by the feet of their followers for over a
hundred years after. On the heels of the men of learning went the
men of fashion, eager to learn and copy the new manners of a
society whose moral teacher was Machiavelli, and whose patterns of
splendour were the courts of Florence and Ferrara, and to learn the
trick of verse that in the hands of Petrarch and his followers had
fashioned the sonnet and other new lyric forms. This could not be
without its influence on the manners of the nation, and the
scholars who had been the first to show the way were the first to
deplore the pell-mell assimilation of Italian manners and vices,
which was the unintended result of the inroad on insularity which
had already begun. They saw the danger ahead, and they laboured to
meet it as it came. Ascham in his <cite>Schoolmaster</cite> railed
against the translation of Italian books, and the corrupt manners
of living and false ideas which they seemed to him to breed. The
Italianate Englishman became the chief part of the stock-in-trade
of the satirists and moralists of the day. Stubbs, a Puritan
chronicler, whose book <cite>The Anatomy of Abuses</cite> is a
valuable aid to the study of Tudor social history, and Harrison,
whose description of England prefaces Holinshed's Chronicles, both
deal in detail with the Italian menace, and condemn in good set
terms the costliness in dress and the looseness in morals which
they laid to its charge. Indeed, the effect on England was
profound, and it lasted for more than two generations. The romantic
traveller, Coryat, writing well within the seventeenth century in
praise of the luxuries of Italy (among which he numbers forks for
table use), is as enthusiastic as the authors who began the
imitation of Italian metres in Tottel's <cite>Miscellany</cite>,
and Donne and Hall in their satires written under James wield the
rod of censure as sternly as had Ascham a good half century before.
No doubt there was something in the danger they dreaded, but the
evil was not unmixed with good, for insularity will always be an
enemy of good literature. The Elizabethans learned much more than
their plots from Italian models, and the worst effects dreaded by
the patriots never reached our shores. Italian vice stopped short
of real life; poisoning and hired ruffianism flourished only on the
stage.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>The influence of the spirit of discovery and adventure, though
it is less quickly marked, more pervasive, and less easy to define,
is perhaps more universal than that of the classics or of the
Italian fashions which came in their train. It runs right through
the literature of Elizabeth's age and after it, affecting, each in
their special way, all the dramatists, authors who were also
adventurers like Raleigh, scholars like Milton, and philosophers
like Hobbes and Locke. It reappears in the Romantic revival with
Coleridge, whose "Ancient Mariner" owes much to reminiscences of
his favourite reading&mdash;<cite>Purchas, his Pilgrimes</cite>,
and other old books of voyages. The matter of this too-little
noticed strain in English literature would suffice to fill a whole
book; only a few of the main lines of its influence can be noted
here.</p>
<p>For the English Renaissance&mdash;for Elizabeth's England,
action and imagination went hand in hand; the dramatists and poets
held up the mirror to the voyagers. In a sense, the cult of the sea
is the oldest note in English literature. There is not a poem in
Anglo-Saxon but breathes the saltness and the bitterness of the
sea-air. To the old English the sea was something inexpressibly
melancholy and desolate, mist-shrouded, and lonely, terrible in its
grey and shivering spaces; and their tone about it is always
elegiac and plaintive, as a place of dreary spiritless wandering
and unmarked graves. When the English settled they lost the sense
of the sea; they became a little parochial people, tilling fields
and tending cattle, wool-gathering and wool-bartering, their
shipping confined to cross-Channel merchandise, and coastwise
sailing from port to port. Chaucer's shipman, almost the sole
representative of the sea in mediaeval English literature, plied a
coastwise trade. But with the Cabots and their followers, Frobisher
and Gilbert and Drake and Hawkins, all this was changed; once more
the ocean became the highway of our national progress and
adventure, and by virtue of our shipping we became competitors for
the dominion of the earth. The rising tide of national enthusiasm
and exaltation that this occasioned flooded popular literature. The
voyagers themselves wrote down the stories of their adventures; and
collections of these&mdash;Hakluyt's and Purchas's&mdash;were among
the most popular books of the age. To them, indeed, we must look
for the first beginnings of our modern English prose, and some of
its noblest passages. The writers, as often as not, were otherwise
utterly unknown&mdash;ship's pursers, super-cargoes, and the
like&mdash;men without much literary craft or training, whose style
is great because of the greatness of their subject, because they
had no literary artifices to stand between them and the plain and
direct telling of a stirring tale. But the ferment worked outside
the actual doings of the voyagers themselves, and it can be traced
beyond definite allusions to them. Allusions, indeed, are
surprisingly few; Drake is scarcely as much as mentioned among the
greater writers of the age. None the less there is not one of them
that is not deeply touched by his spirit and that of the movement
which he led. New lands had been discovered, new territories opened
up, wonders exposed which were perhaps only the first fruits of
greater wonders to come. Spenser makes the voyagers his warrant for
his excursion into fairyland. Some, he says, have condemned his
fairy world as an idle fiction,</p>
<div class="poem">"But let that man with better sense advise;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That of the world least part to
us is red;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And daily how through hardy
enterprise</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Many great regions are
discovered,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which to late age were never
mentioned.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who ever heard of the 'Indian
Peru'?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or who in venturous vessel
measured</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Amazon, huge river, now found
true?</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or fruitfullest Virginia who did

<br>
"Yet all these were, when no man did them know,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet have from wiser ages hidden
been;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And later times things more
unknown shall show."</span></div>
<p>It is in the drama that this spirit of adventure caught from the
voyagers gets its full play. "Without the voyagers," says Professor
Walter Raleigh,[<a href="#note-1">1</a>] "Marlowe is
inconceivable." His imagination in every one of his plays is
preoccupied with the lust of adventure, and the wealth and power
adventure brings. Tamburlaine, Eastern conqueror though he is, is
at heart an Englishman of the school of Hawkins and Drake. Indeed
the comparison must have occurred to his own age, for a historian
of the day, the antiquary Stow, declares Drake to have been "as
famous in Europe and America as Tamburlaine was in Asia and
Africa." The high-sounding names and quests which seem to us to
give the play an air of unreality and romance were to the
Elizabethans real and actual; things as strange and foreign were to
be heard any day amongst the motley crowd in the Bankside outside
the theatre door. Tamburlaine's last speech, when he calls for a
map and points the way to unrealised conquests, is the very epitome
of the age of discovery.</p>
<div class="poem">"Lo, here my sons, are all the golden mines,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Inestimable wares and precious
stones,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">More worth than Asia and all the
world beside;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And from the Antarctic Pole
eastward behold</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As much more land, which never
was descried.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Wherein are rocks of pearl that
shine as bright</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As all the lamps that beautify
the sky."</span></div>
<br>
<p>It is the same in his other plays. Dr. Faustus assigns to his
serviceable spirits tasks that might have been studied from the
books of Hakluyt</p>
<div class="poem">"I'll have them fly to India for gold,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ransack the ocean for orient
pearl,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And search all corners of the new
round world</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For pleasant fruits and princely
delicates."</span></div>
<p>When there is no actual expression of the spirit of adventure,
the air of the sea which it carried with it still blows.
Shakespeare, save for his scenes in <cite>The Tempest</cite> and in
<cite>Pericles</cite>, which seize in all its dramatic poignancy
the terror of storm and shipwreck, has nothing dealing directly
with the sea or with travel; but it comes out, none the less, in
figure and metaphor, and plays like the <cite>Merchant of
Venice</cite> and <cite>Othello</cite> testify to his accessibility
to its spirit. Milton, a scholar whose mind was occupied by other
and more ultimate matters, is full of allusions to it. Satan's
journey through Chaos in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> is the occasion
for a whole series of metaphors drawn from seafaring. In
<cite>Samson Agonistes</cite> Dalila comes in,</p>
<div class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Like a stately
ship ...</span><br>
With all her bravery on and tackle trim<br>
Sails frilled and streamers waving<br>
Courted by all the winds that hold them play."</div>
<br>
and Samson speaks of himself as one who,<br>
<br>
<div class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Like a foolish
pilot have shipwracked</span><br>
My vessel trusted to me from above<br>
Gloriously rigged."</div>
<p>The influence of the voyages of discovery persisted long after
the first bloom of the Renaissance had flowered and withered. On
the reports brought home by the voyagers were founded in part those
conceptions of the condition of the "natural" man which form such a
large part of the philosophic discussions of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, Hobbes's description of the life of nature as
"nasty, solitary, brutish, and short," Locke's theories of civil
government, and eighteenth century speculators like Monboddo all
took as the basis of their theory the observations of the men of
travel. Abroad this connection of travellers and philosophers was
no less intimate. Both Montesquieu and Rousseau owed much to the
tales of the Iroquois, the North American Indian allies of France.
Locke himself is the best example of the closeness of this
alliance. He was a diligent student of the texts of the voyagers,
and himself edited out of Hakluyt and Purchas the best collection
of them current in his day. The purely literary influence of the
age of discovery persisted down to <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>; in
that book by a refinement of satire a return to travel itself (it
must be remembered Defoe posed not as a novelist but as an actual
traveller) is used to make play with the deductions founded on it.
Crusoe's conversation with the man Friday will be found to be a
satire of Locke's famous controversy with the Bishop of Worcester.
With <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite> the influence of the age of
discovery finally perishes. An inspiration hardens into the mere
subject matter of books of adventure. We need not follow it
further.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<br>
<h3>ELIZABETHAN POETRY AND PROSE</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>To understand Elizabethan literature it is necessary to remember
that the social status it enjoyed was far different from that of
literature in our own day. The splendours of the Medicis in Italy
had set up an ideal of courtliness, in which letters formed an
integral and indispensable part. For the Renaissance, the man of
letters was only one aspect of the gentleman, and the true
gentleman, as books so early and late respectively as Castiglione's
<cite>Courtier</cite> and Peacham's <cite>Complete Gentleman</cite>
show, numbered poetry as a necessary part of his accomplishments.
In England special circumstances intensified this tendency of the
time. The queen was unmarried: she was the first single woman to
wear the English crown, and her vanity made her value the devotion
of the men about her as something more intimate than mere loyalty
or patriotism. She loved personal homage, particularly the homage
of half-amatory eulogy in prose and verse. It followed that the
ambition of every courtier was to be an author, and of every author
to be a courtier; in fact, outside the drama, which was almost the
only popular writing at the time, every author was in a greater or
less degree attached to the court. If they were not enjoying its
favours they were pleading for them, mingling high and fantastic
compliment with bitter reproaches and a tale of misery. And
consequently both the poetry and the prose of the time are
restricted in their scope and temper to the artificial and
romantic, to high-flown eloquence, to the celebration of love and
devotion, or to the inculcation of those courtly virtues and
accomplishments which composed the perfect pattern of a gentleman.
Not that there was not both poetry and prose written outside this
charmed circle. The pamphleteers and chroniclers, Dekker and Nash,
Holinshed and Harrison and Stow, were setting down their histories
and descriptions, and penning those detailed and realistic
indictments of the follies and extravagances of fashion, which
together with the comedies have enabled us to picture accurately
the England and especially the London of Elizabeth's reign. There
was fine poetry written by Marlowe and Chapman as well as by Sidney
and Spenser, but the court was still the main centre of literary
endeavour, and the main incitement to literary fame and
success.</p>
<p>But whether an author was a courtier or a Londoner living by his
wits, writing was never the main business of his life: all the
writers of the time were in one way or another men of action and
affairs. As late as Milton it is probably true to say that writing
was in the case even of the greatest an avocation, something
indulged in at leisure outside a man's main business. All the
Elizabethan authors had crowded and various careers. Of Sir Philip
Sidney his earliest biographer says, "The truth is his end was not
writing, even while he wrote, but both his wit and understanding
bent upon his heart to make himself and others not in words or
opinion but in life and action good and great." Ben Jonson was in
turn a soldier, a poet, a bricklayer, an actor, and ultimately the
first poet laureate. Lodge, after leaving Oxford, passed through
the various professions of soldiering, medicine, playwriting, and
fiction, and he wrote his novel <cite>Rosalind</cite>, on which
Shakespeare based <cite>As You Like It</cite> while he was sailing
on a piratical venture on the Spanish Main. This connection between
life and action affected as we have seen the tone and quality of
Elizabethan writing. "All the distinguished writers of the period,"
says Thoreau, "possess a greater vigour and naturalness than the
more modern ... you have constantly the warrant of life and
experience in what you read. The little that is said is eked out by
implication of the much that was done." In another passage the same
writer explains the strength and fineness of the writings of Sir
Walter Raleigh by this very test of action, "The word which is best
said came nearest to not being spoken at all, for it is cousin to a
deed which the speaker could have better done. Nay almost it must
have taken the place of a deed by some urgent necessity, even by
some misfortune, so that the truest writer will be some captive
knight after all." This bond between literature and action explains
more than the writings of the voyagers or the pamphlets of men who
lived in London by what they could make of their fellows.
Literature has always a two-fold relation to life as it is lived.
It is both a mirror and an escape: in our own day the stirring
romances of Stevenson, the full-blooded and vigorous life which
beats through the pages of Mr. Kipling, the conscious brutalism of
such writers as Mr. Conrad and Mr. Hewlett, the plays of J.M.
Synge, occupied with the vigorous and coarse-grained life of
tinkers and peasants, are all in their separate ways a reaction
against an age in which the overwhelming majority of men and women
have sedentary pursuits. Just in the same way the Elizabethan who
passed his commonly short and crowded life in an atmosphere of
throat-cutting and powder and shot, and in a time when affairs of
state were more momentous for the future of the nation than they
have ever been since, needed his escape from the things which
pressed in upon him every day. So grew the vogue and popularity of
pastoral poetry and of pastoral romance.</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>It is with two courtiers that modern English poetry begins. The
lives of Sir Thomas Wyatt and the Earl of Surrey both ended early
and unhappily, and it was not until ten years after the death of
the second of them that their poems appeared in print. The book
that contained them, Tottel's <cite>Miscellany of Songs and
Sonnets</cite>, is one of the landmarks of English literature. It
begins lyrical love poetry in our language. It begins, too, the
imitation and adaptation of foreign and chiefly Italian metrical
forms, many of which have since become characteristic forms of
English verse: so characteristic, that we scarcely think of them as
other than native in origin. To Wyatt belongs the honour of
introducing the sonnet, and to Surrey the more momentous credit of
writing, for the first time in English, blank verse. Wyatt fills
the most important place in the <cite>Miscellany</cite>, and his
work, experimental in tone and quality, formed the example which
Surrey and minor writers in the same volume and all the later poets
of the age copied. He tries his hand at everything&mdash;songs,
madrigals, elegies, complaints, and sonnets&mdash;and he takes his
models from both ancient Rome and modern Italy. Indeed there is
scarcely anything in the volume for which with some trouble and
research one might not find an original in Petrarch, or in the
poets of Italy who followed him. But imitation, universal though it
is in his work, does not altogether crowd out originality of
feeling and poetic temper. At times, he sounds a personal note, his
joy on leaving Spain for England, his feelings in the Tower, his
life at the Court amongst his books, and as a country gentleman
enjoying hunting and other outdoor sports.</p>
<div class="poem">"This maketh me at home to hunt and hawk,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And in foul weather at my book to
sit,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In frost and snow, then with my
bow to stalk,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No man does mark whereas I ride
or go:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In lusty leas at liberty I
walk."</span></div>
<p>It is easy to see that poetry as a melodious and enriched
expression of a man's own feelings is in its infancy here. The new
poets had to find their own language, to enrich with borrowings
from other tongues the stock of words suitable for poetry which the
dropping of inflection had left to English. Wyatt was at the
beginning of the process, and apart from a gracious and courtly
temper, his work has, it must be confessed, hardly more than an
antiquarian interest. Surrey, it is possible to say on reading his
work, went one step further. He allows himself oftener the luxury
of a reference to personal feelings, and his poetry contains from
place to place a fairly full record of the vicissitudes of his
life. A prisoner at Windsor, he recalls his childhood there</p>
<div class="poem">"The large green courts where we were wont to
hove,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The palme-play, where, despoiled
for the game.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With dazzled eyes oft we by
gleams of love</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Have missed the ball, and got
sight of our dame."</span></div>
<p>Like Wyatt's, his verses are poor stuff, but a sympathetic ear
can catch in them something of the accent that distinguishes the
verse of Sidney and Spenser. He is greater than Wyatt, not so much
for greater skill as for more boldness in experiment. Wyatt in his
sonnets had used the Petrarchan or Italian form, the form used
later in England by Milton and in the nineteenth century by
Rossetti. He built up each poem, that is, in two parts, the octave,
a two-rhymed section of eight lines at the beginning, followed by
the sestet, a six line close with three rhymes. The form fits
itself very well to the double mood which commonly inspires a poet
using the sonnet form; the second section as it were both echoing
and answering the first, following doubt with hope, or sadness with
resignation, or resolving a problem set itself by the heart. Surrey
tried another manner, the manner which by its use in Shakespeare's
sonnets has come to be regarded as the English form of this kind of
lyric. His sonnets are virtually three-stanza poems with a couplet
for close, and he allows himself as many rhymes as he chooses. The
structure is obviously easier, and it gives a better chance to an
inferior workman, but in the hands of a master its harmonies are no
less delicate, and its capacity to represent changing modes of
thought no less complete than those of the true form of Petrarch.
Blank verse, which was Surrey's other gift to English poetry, was
in a way a compromise between the two sources from which the
English Renaissance drew its inspiration. Latin and Greek verse is
quantitative and rhymeless; Italian verse, built up on the metres
of the troubadours and the degeneration of Latin which gave the
world the Romance languages, used many elaborate forms of rhyme.
Blank verse took from Latin its rhymelessness, but it retained
accent instead of quantity as the basis of its line. The line
Surrey used is the five-foot or ten-syllable line of what is called
"heroic verse"&mdash;the line used by Chaucer in his Prologue and
most of his tales. Like Milton he deplored rhyme as the invention
of a barbarous age, and no doubt he would have rejoiced to go
further and banish accent as well as rhymed endings. That, however,
was not to be, though in the best blank verse of later time accent
and quantity both have their share in the effect. The instrument he
forged passed into the hands of the dramatists: Marlowe perfected
its rhythm, Shakespeare broke its monotony and varied its cadences
by altering the spacing of the accents, and occasionally by adding
an extra unaccented syllable. It came back from the drama to poetry
with Milton. His blindness and the necessity under which it laid
him of keeping in his head long stretches of verse at one time,
because he could not look back to see what he had written, probably
helped his naturally quick and delicate sense of cadence to vary
the pauses, so that a variety of accent and interval might replace
the valuable aid to memory which he put aside in putting aside
rhyme. Perhaps it is to two accidents, the accident by which blank
verse as the medium of the actor had to be retained easily in the
memory, and the accident of Milton's blindness, that must be laid
the credit of more than a little of the richness of rhythm of this,
the chief and greatest instrument of English verse.</p>
<p>The imitation of Italian and French forms which Wyatt and Surrey
began, was continued by a host of younger amateurs of poetry.
Laborious research has indeed found a Continental original for
almost every great poem of the time, and for very many forgotten
ones as well. It is easy for the student engaged in this kind of
literary exploration to exaggerate the importance of what he finds,
and of late years criticism, written mainly by these explorers, has
tended to assume that since it can be found that Sidney, and
Daniel, and Watson, and all the other writers of mythological
poetry and sonnet sequences took their ideas and their phrases from
foreign poetry, their work is therefore to be classed merely as
imitative literary exercise, that it is frigid, that it contains or
conveys no real feeling, and that except in the secondary and
derived sense, it is not really lyrical at all. Petrarch, they will
tell you, may have felt deeply and sincerely about Laura, but when
Sidney uses Petrarch's imagery and even translates his words in
order to express his feelings for Stella, he is only a plagiarist
and not a lover, and the passion for Lady Rich which is supposed to
have inspired his sonnets, nothing more than a not too seriously
intended trick to add the excitement of a transcript of real
emotion to what was really an academic exercise. If that were
indeed so, then Elizabethan poetry is a very much lesser and meaner
thing than later ages have thought it. But is it so? Let us look
into the matter a little more closely. The unit of all ordinary
kinds of writing is the word, and one is not commonly quarrelled
with for using words that have belonged to other people. But the
unit of the lyric, like the unit of spoken conversation, is not the
word but the phrase. Now in daily human intercourse the use, which
is universal and habitual, of set forms and phrases of talk is not
commonly supposed to detract from, or destroy sincerity. In the
crises indeed of emotion it must be most people's experience that
the natural speech that rises unbidden and easiest to the lips is
something quite familiar and commonplace, some form which the
accumulated experience of many generations of separate people has
found best for such circumstances or such an occasion. The lyric is
just in the position of conversation, at such a heightened and
emotional moment. It is the speech of deep feeling, that must be
articulate or choke, and it falls naturally and inevitably into
some form which accumulated passionate moments have created and
fixed. The course of emotional experiences differs very little from
age to age, and from individual to individual, and so the same
phrases may be used quite sincerely and naturally as the direct
expression of feeling at its highest point by men apart in country,
circumstances, or time. This is not to say that there is no such
thing as originality; a poet is a poet first and most of all
because he discovers truths that have been known for ages, as
things that are fresh and new and vital for himself. He must speak
of them in language that has been used by other men just because
they are known truths, but he will use that language in a new way,
and with a new significance, and it is just in proportion to the
freshness, and the air of personal conviction and sincerity which
he imparts to it, that he is great.</p>
<p>The point at issue bears very directly on the work of Sir Philip
Sidney. In the course of the history of English letters certain
authors disengage themselves who have more than a merely literary
position: they are symbolic of the whole age in which they live,
its life and action, its thoughts and ideals, as well as its mere
modes of writing. There are not many of them and they could be
easily numbered; Addison, perhaps, certainly Dr. Johnson, certainly
Byron, and in the later age probably Tennyson. But the greatest of
them all is Sir Philip Sidney: his symbolical relation to the time
in which he lived was realized by his contemporaries, and it has
been a commonplace of history and criticism ever since. Elizabeth
called him one of the jewels of her crown, and at the age of
twenty-three, so fast did genius ripen in that summer time of the
Renaissance, William the Silent could speak of him as "one of the
ripest statesmen of the age." He travelled widely in Europe, knew
many languages, and dreamed of adventure in America and on the high
seas. In a court of brilliant figures, his was the most dazzling,
and his death at Zutphen only served to intensify the halo of
romance which had gathered round his name. His literary exercises
were various: in prose he wrote the <cite>Arcadia</cite> and the
<cite>Apology for Poetry</cite>, the one the beginning of a new
kind of imaginative writing, and the other the first of the series
of those rare and precious commentaries on their own art which some
of our English poets have left us. To the <cite>Arcadia</cite> we
shall have to return later in this chapter. It is his other great
work, the sequence of sonnets entitled <cite>Astrophel and
Stella</cite>, which concerns us here. They celebrate the history
of his love for Penelope Devereux, sister of the Earl of Essex, a
love brought to disaster by the intervention of Queen Elizabeth
with whom he had quarrelled. As poetry they mark an epoch. They are
the first direct expression of an intimate and personal experience
in English literature, struck off in the white heat of passion, and
though they are coloured at times with that over-fantastic imagery
which is at once a characteristic fault and excellence of the
writing of the time, they never lose the one merit above all others
of lyric poetry, the merit of sincerity. The note is struck with
certainty and power in the first sonnet of the series:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to
show,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That she, dear she, might take
some pleasure of my pain,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pleasure might cause her read,
reading might make her know,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Knowledge might pity win, and
pity grace obtain,&mdash;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I sought fit words to paint the
blackest face of woe,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Studying inventions fine her wits
to entertain;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oft turning others' leaves to see
if thence would flow</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Some fresh and fruitful flower
upon my sunburned brain.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But words came halting forth
...</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Biting my truant pen, beating
myself for spite,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Fool,' said my muse to me, 'look
in thy heart and write.'"</span></div>
<br>
And though he turned others' leaves it was quite literally looking
in his heart that he wrote. He analyses the sequence of his
feelings with a vividness and minuteness which assure us of their
truth. All that he tells is the fruit of experience, dearly
bought:<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Desire! desire! I have too dearly bought<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With price of mangled mind thy
worthless ware.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Too long, too long! asleep thou
hast me brought,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who shouldst my mind to higher
things prepare."</span></div>
<br>
and earlier in the sequence&mdash;<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"I now have learned love right and learned even
so<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As those that being poisoned
poison know."</span></div>
<br>
In the last two sonnets, with crowning truth and pathos he
renounces earthly love which reaches but to dust, and which because
it fades brings but fading pleasure:<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Then farewell, world! Thy uttermost I see.<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Eternal love, maintain thy life
in me."</span></div>
<p>The sonnets were published after Sidney's death, and it is
certain that like Shakespeare's they were never intended for
publication at all. The point is important because it helps to
vindicate Sidney's sincerity, but were any vindication needed
another more certain might be found. The <cite>Arcadia</cite> is
strewn with love songs and sonnets, the exercises solely of the
literary imagination. Let any one who wishes to gauge the sincerity
of the impulse of the Stella sequence compare any of the poems in
it with those in the romance.</p>
<p>With Sir Philip Sidney literature was an avocation, constantly
indulged in, but outside the main business of his life; with Edmund
Spenser public life and affairs were subservient to an
overmastering poetic impulse. He did his best to carve out a career
for himself like other young men of his time, followed the fortunes
of the Earl of Leicester, sought desperately and unavailingly the
favour of the Queen, and ultimately accepted a place in her service
in Ireland, which meant banishment as virtually as a place in India
would to-day. Henceforward his visits to London and the Court were
few; sometimes a lover of travel would visit him in his house in
Ireland as Raleigh did, but for the most he was left alone. It was
in this atmosphere of loneliness and separation, hostile tribes
pinning him in on every side, murder lurking in the woods and
marshes round him, that he composed his greatest work. In it at
last he died, on the heels of a sudden rising in which his house
was burnt and his lands over-run by the wild Irish whom the tyranny
of the English planters had driven to vengeance. Spenser was not
without interest in his public duties; his <cite>View of the State
of Ireland</cite> shows that. But it shows, too, that he brought to
them singularly little sympathy or imagination. Throughout his tone
is that of the worst kind of English officialdom; rigid subjection
and in the last resort massacre are the remedies he would apply to
Irish discontent. He would be a fine text&mdash;which might be
enforced by modern examples&mdash;for a discourse on the evil
effects of immersion in the government of a subject race upon men
of letters. No man of action can be so consistently and cynically
an advocate of brutalism as your man of letters, Spenser, of
course, had his excuses; the problem of Ireland was new and it was
something remote and difficult; in all but the mere distance for
travel, Dublin was as far from London as Bombay is to-day. But to
him and his like we must lay down partly the fact that to-day we
have still an Irish problem.</p>
<p>But though fate and the necessity of a livelihood drove him to
Ireland and the life of a colonist, poetry was his main business.
He had been the centre of a brilliant set at Cambridge, one of
those coteries whose fame, if they are brilliant and vivacious
enough and have enough self-confidence, penetrates to the outer
world before they leave the University. The thing happens in our
own day, as the case of Oscar Wilde is witness; it happened in the
case of Spenser; and when he and his friends Gabriel Harvey and
Edward Kirke came "down" it was to immediate fame amongst amateurs
of the arts. They corresponded with each other about literary
matters, and Harvey published his part of the correspondence; they
played like Du Bellay in France, with the idea of writing English
verse in the quantitative measures of classical poetry; Spenser had
a love affair in Yorkshire and wrote poetry about it, letting just
enough be known to stimulate the imagination of the public. They
tried their hands at everything, imitated everything, and in all
were brilliant, sparkling, and decorative; they got a kind of
entrance to the circle of the Court. Then Spenser published his
<cite>Shepherd's Calendar</cite>, a series of pastoral eclogues for
every month of the year, after a manner taken from French and
Italian pastoral writers, but coming ultimately from Vergil, and
Edward Kirke furnished it with an elaborate prose commentary.
Spenser took the same liberties with the pastoral form as did
Vergil himself; that is to say he used it as a vehicle for satire
and allegory, made it carry political and social allusions, and
planted in it references to his friends. By its publication Spenser
became the first poet of the day. It was followed by some of his
finest and most beautiful things&mdash;by the Platonic hymns, by
the <cite>Amoretti</cite>, a series of sonnets inspired by his love
for his wife; by the <cite>Epithalamium</cite>, on the occasion of
his marriage to her; by <cite>Mother Hubbard's Tale</cite>, a
satire written when despair at the coldness of the Queen and the
enmity of Burleigh was beginning to take hold on the poet and
endowed with a plainness and vigour foreign to most of his other
work&mdash;and then by <cite>The Fairy Queen</cite>.</p>
<p>The poets of the Renaissance were not afraid of big things;
every one of them had in his mind as the goal of poetic endeavour
the idea of the heroic poem, aimed at doing for his own country
what Vergil had intended to do for Rome in the <cite>Aeneid</cite>,
to celebrate it&mdash;its origin, its prowess, its greatness, and
the causes of it, in epic verse. Milton, three-quarters of a
century later, turned over in his mind the plan of an English epic
on the wars of Arthur, and when he left it was only to forsake the
singing of English origins for the more ultimate theme of the
origins of mankind. Spenser designed to celebrate the character,
the qualities and the training of the English gentleman. And
because poetry, unlike philosophy, cannot deal with abstractions
but must be vivid and concrete, he was forced to embody his virtues
and foes to virtue and to use the way of allegory. His outward
plan, with its knights and dragons and desperate adventures, he
procured from Ariosto. As for the use of allegory, it was one of
the discoveries of the Middle Ages which the Renaissance
condescended to retain. Spenser elaborated it beyond the wildest
dreams of those students of Holy Writ who had first conceived it.
His stories were to be interesting in themselves as tales of
adventure, but within them they were to conceal an intricate
treatment of the conflict of truth and falsehood in morals and
religion. A character might typify at once Protestantism and
England and Elizabeth and chastity and half the cardinal virtues,
and it would have all the while the objective interest attaching to
it as part of a story of adventure. All this must have made the
poem difficult enough. Spenser's manner of writing it made it worse
still. One is familiar with the type of novel which only explains
itself when the last chapter is reached&mdash;Stevenson's
<cite>Wrecker</cite> is an example. <cite>The Fairy Queen</cite>
was designed on somewhat the same plan. The last section was to
relate and explain the unrelated and unexplained books which made
up the poem, and at the court to which the separate knights of the
separate books&mdash;the Red Cross Knight and the rest&mdash;were
to bring the fruit of their adventures, everything was to be made
clear. Spenser did not live to finish his work; <cite>The Fairy
Queen</cite>, like the <cite>Aeneid</cite>, is an uncompleted poem,
and it is only from a prefatory letter to Sir Walter Raleigh issued
with the second published section that we know what the poem was
intended to be. Had Spenser not published this explanation, it is
impossible that anybody, even the acutest minded German professor,
could have guessed.</p>
<p>The poem, as we have seen, was composed in Ireland, in the
solitude of a colonists' plantation, and the author was shut off
from his fellows while he wrote. The influence of his surroundings
is visible in the writing. The elaboration of the theme would have
been impossible or at least very unlikely if its author had not
been thrown in on himself during its composition. Its intricacy and
involution is the product of an over-concentration born of empty
surroundings. It lacks vigour and rapidity; it winds itself into
itself. The influence of Ireland, too, is visible in its
landscapes, in its description of bogs and desolation, of dark
forests in which lurk savages ready to spring out on those who are
rash enough to wander within their confines. All the scenery in it
which is not imaginary is Irish and not English scenery.</p>
<p>Its reception in England and at the Court was enthusiastic. Men
and women read it eagerly and longed for the next section as our
grandfathers longed for the next section of <cite>Pickwick</cite>.
They really liked it, really loved the intricacy and luxuriousness
of it, the heavy exotic language, the thickly painted descriptions,
the languorous melody of the verse. Mainly, perhaps, that was so
because they were all either in wish or in deed poets themselves.
Spenser has always been "the poets' poet." Milton loved him; so did
Dryden, who said that Milton confessed to him that Spenser was "his
original," a statement which has been pronounced incredible, but
is, in truth, perfectly comprehensible, and most likely true. Pope
admired him; Keats learned from him the best part of his music. You
can trace echoes of him in Mr. Yeats. What is it that gives him
this hold on his peers? Well, in the first place his defects do not
detract from his purely poetic qualities. The story is impossibly
told, but that will only worry those who are looking for a story.
The allegory is hopelessly difficult; but as Hazlitt said "the
allegory will not bite you"; you can let it alone. The crudeness
and bigotry of Spenser's dealings with Catholicism, which are
ridiculous when he pictures the monster Error vomiting books and
pamphlets, and disgusting when he draws Mary Queen of Scots, do not
hinder the pleasure of those who read him for his language and his
art. He is great for other reasons than these. First because of the
extraordinary smoothness and melody of his verse and the richness
of his language&mdash;a golden diction that he drew from every
source&mdash;new words, old words, obsolete words&mdash;such a
mixture that the purist Ben Jonson remarked acidly that he wrote no
language at all. Secondly because of the profusion of his imagery,
and the extraordinarily keen sense for beauty and sweetness that
went to its making. In an age of golden language and gallant
imagery his was the most golden and the most gallant. And the
language of poetry in England is richer and more varied than that
in any other country in Europe to-day, because of what he did.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>Elizabethan prose brings us face to face with a difficulty which
has to be met by every student of literature. Does the word
"literature" cover every kind of writing? Ought we to include in it
writing that aims merely at instruction or is merely journey-work,
as well as writing that has an artistic intention, or writing that,
whether its author knew it or no, is artistic in its result? Of
course such a question causes us no sort of difficulty when it
concerns itself only with what is being published to-day. We know
very well that some things are literature and some merely
journalism; that of novels, for instance, some deliberately intend
to be works of art and others only to meet a passing desire for
amusement or mental occupation. We know that most books serve or
attempt to serve only a useful and not a literary purpose. But in
reading the books of three centuries ago, unconsciously one's point
of view shifts. Antiquity gilds journey-work; remoteness and
quaintness of phrasing lend a kind of distinction to what are
simply pamphlets or text-books that have been preserved by accident
from the ephemeralness which was the common lot of hundreds of
their fellows. One comes to regard as literature things that had no
kind of literary value for their first audiences; to apply the same
seriousness of judgment and the same tests to the pamphlets of Nash
and Dekker as to the prose of Sidney and Bacon. One loses, in fact,
that power to distinguish the important from the trivial which is
one of the functions of a sound literary taste. Now, a study of the
minor writing of the past is, of course, well worth a reader's
pains. Pamphlets, chronicle histories, text-books and the like have
an historical importance; they give us glimpses of the manners and
habits and modes of thought of the day. They tell us more about the
outward show of life than do the greater books. If you are
interested in social history, they are the very thing. But the
student of literature ought to beware of them, nor ought he to
touch them till he is familiar with the big and lasting things. A
man does not possess English literature if he knows what Dekker
tells of the seven deadly sins of London and does not know the
<cite>Fairy Queen</cite>. Though the wide and curious interest of
the Romantic critics of the nineteenth century found and illumined
the byways of Elizabethan writing, the safest method of approach is
the method of their predecessors&mdash;to keep hold on common
sense, to look at literature, not historically as through the wrong
end of a telescope, but closely and without a sense of intervening
time, to know the best&mdash;the "classic"&mdash;and study it
before the minor things.</p>
<p>In Elizabeth's reign, prose became for the first time, with
cheapened printing, the common vehicle of amusement and
information, and the books that remain to us cover many departments
of writing. There are the historians who set down for us for the
first time what they knew of the earlier history of England. There
are the writers, like Harrison and Stubbs, who described the
England of their own day, and there are many authors, mainly
anonymous, who wrote down the accounts of the voyages of the
discoverers in the Western Seas. There are the novelists who
translated stories mainly from Italian sources. But of authors as
conscious of a literary intention as the poets were, there are only
two, Sidney and Lyly, and of authors who, though their first aim
was hardly an artistic one, achieved an artistic result, only
Hooker and the translators of the Bible. The Authorized Version of
the Bible belongs strictly not to the reign of Elizabeth but to
that of James, and we shall have to look at it when we come to
discuss the seventeenth century. Hooker, in his book on
Ecclesiastical Polity (an endeavour to set forth the grounds of
orthodox Anglicanism) employed a generous, flowing, melodious style
which has influenced many writers since and is familiar to us
to-day in the copy of it used by Ruskin in his earlier works. Lyly
and Sidney are worth looking at more closely.</p>
<p>The age was intoxicated with language. It went mad of a mere
delight in words. Its writers were using a new tongue, for English
was enriched beyond all recognition with borrowings from the
ancient authors; and like all artists who become possessed of a new
medium, they used it to excess. The early Elizabethans' use of the
new prose was very like the use that educated Indians make of
English to-day. It is not that these write it incorrectly, but only
that they write too richly. And just as fuller use and knowledge
teaches them spareness and economy and gives their writing
simplicity and vigour, so seventeenth century practice taught
Englishmen to write a more direct and undecorated style and gave us
the smooth, simple, and vigorous writing of Dryden&mdash;the first
really modern English prose. But the Elizabethans loved gaudier
methods; they liked highly decorative modes of expression, in prose
no less than in verse. The first author to give them these things
was John Lyly, whose book <cite>Euphues</cite> was for the five or
six years following its publication a fashionable craze that
infected all society and gave its name to a peculiar and highly
artificial style of writing that coloured the work of hosts of
obscure and forgotten followers. Lyly wrote other things; his
comedies may have taught Shakespeare the trick of <cite>Love's
Labour Lost</cite>; he attempted a sequel of his most famous work
with better success than commonly attends sequels, but for us and
for his own generation he is the author of one book. Everybody read
it, everybody copied it. The maxims and sentences of advice for
gentlemen which it contained were quoted and admired in the Court,
where the author, though he never attained the lucrative position
he hoped for, did what flattery could do to make a name for
himself. The name "Euphuism" became a current description of an
artificial way of using words that overflowed out of writing into
speech and was in the mouths, while the vogue lasted, of everybody
who was anybody in the circle that fluttered round the Queen.</p>
<p>The style of <cite>Euphues</cite> was parodied by Shakespeare
and many attempts have been made to imitate it since. Most of them
are inaccurate&mdash;Sir Walter Scott's wild attempt the most
inaccurate of all. They fail because their authors have imagined
that "Euphuism" is simply a highly artificial and "flowery" way of
talking. As a matter of fact it is made up of a very exact and very
definite series of parts. The writing is done on a plan which has
three main characteristics as follows. First, the structure of the
sentence is based on antithesis and alliteration; that is to say,
it falls into equal parts similar in sound but with a different
sense; for example, Euphues is described as a young gallant "of
more wit than wealth, yet of more wealth than wisdom." All the
characters in the book, which is roughly in the form of a novel,
speak in this way, sometimes in sentences long drawn out which are
oppressively monotonous and tedious, and sometimes shortly with a
certain approach to epigram. The second characteristic of the style
is the reference of every stated fact to some classical authority,
that is to say, the author cannot mention friendship without
quoting David and Jonathan, nor can lovers in his book accuse each
other of faithlessness without quoting the instance of Cressida or
Aeneas. This appeal to classical authority and wealth of classical
allusion is used to decorate pages which deal with matters of
every-day experience. Seneca, for instance, is quoted as reporting
"that too much bending breaketh the bow," a fact which might
reasonably have been supposed to be known to the author himself.
This particular form of writing perhaps influenced those who copied
Lyly more than anything else in his book. It is a fashion of the
more artificial kind of Elizabethan writing in all schools to
employ a wealth of classical allusion. Even the simple narratives
in <cite>Hakluyt's Voyages</cite> are not free from it, and one may
hardly hope to read an account of a voyage to the Indies without
stumbling on a preliminary reference to the opinions of Aristotle
and Plato. Lastly, <cite>Euphues</cite> is characterised by an
extraordinary wealth of allusion to natural history, mostly of a
fabulous kind. "I have read that the bull being tied to the fig
tree loseth his tail; that the whole herd of deer stand at gaze if
they smell a sweet apple; that the dolphin after the sound of music
is brought to the shore," and so on. His book is full of these
things, and the style weakens and loses its force because of
them.</p>
<p>Of course there is much more in his book than this outward
decoration. He wrote with the avowed purpose of instructing
courtiers and gentlemen how to live. <cite>Euphues</cite> is full
of grave reflections and weighty morals, and is indeed a collection
of essays on education, on friendship, on religion and philosophy,
and on the favourite occupation and curriculum of Elizabethan
youth&mdash;foreign travel. The fashions and customs of his
countrymen which he condemns in the course of his teaching are the
same as those inveighed against by Stubbs and other contemporaries.
He disliked manners and fashions copied from Italy; particularly he
disliked the extravagant fashions of women. One woman only escapes
his censure, and she, of course, is the Queen, whom Euphues and his
companion in the book come to England to see. In the main the
teaching of Euphues inculcates a humane and liberal, if not very
profound creed, and the book shares with <cite>The Fairy
Queen</cite> the honour of the earlier Puritanism&mdash;the
Puritanism that besides the New Testament had the
<cite>Republic</cite>.</p>
<p>But Euphues, though he was in his time the popular idol, was not
long in finding a successful rival. Seven years before his death
Sir Philip Sidney, in a period of retirement from the Court wrote
"<cite>The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia</cite>"; it was published
ten years after it had been composed. The <cite>Arcadia</cite> is
the first English example of the prose pastoral romance, as the
<cite>Shepherd's Calendar</cite> is of our pastoral verse.
Imitative essays in its style kept appearing for two hundred years
after it, till Wordsworth and other poets who knew the country
drove its unrealities out of literature. The aim of it and of the
school to which it belonged abroad was to find a setting for a
story which should leave the author perfectly free to plant in it
any improbability he liked, and to do what he liked with the
relations of his characters. In the shade of beech trees, the coils
of elaborated and intricate love-making wind and unravel themselves
through an endless afternoon. In that art nothing is too
far-fetched, nothing too sentimental, no sorrow too unreal. The
pastoral romance was used, too, to cover other things besides a
sentimental and decorative treatment of love. Authors wrapped up as
shepherds their political friends and enemies, and the pastoral
eclogues in verse which Spenser and others composed are full of
personal and political allusion. Sidney's story carries no politics
and he depends for its interest solely on the wealth of differing
episodes and the stories and arguments of love which it contains.
The story would furnish plot enough for twenty ordinary novels, but
probably those who read it when it was published were attracted by
other things than the march of its incidents. Certainly no one
could read it for the plot now. Its attraction is mainly one of
style. It goes, you feel, one degree beyond <cite>Euphues</cite> in
the direction of freedom and poetry. And just because of this
greater freedom, its characteristics are much less easy to fix than
those of <cite>Euphues</cite>. Perhaps its chief quality is best
described as that of exhaustiveness. Sidney will take a word and
toss it to and fro in a page till its meaning is sucked dry and
more than sucked dry. On page after page the same trick is
employed, often in some new and charming way, but with the
inevitable effect of wearying the reader, who tries to do the
unwisest of all things with a book of this kind&mdash;to read on.
This trick of bandying words is, of course, common in Shakespeare.
Other marks of Sidney's style belong similarly to poetry rather
than to prose. Chief of them is what Ruskin christened the
"pathetic fallacy"&mdash;the assumption (not common in his day)
which connects the appearance of nature with the moods of the
artist who looks at it, or demands such a connection. In its day
the <cite>Arcadia</cite> was hailed as a reformation by men
nauseated by the rhythmical patterns of Lyly. A modern reader finds
himself confronting it in something of the spirit that he would
confront the prose romances, say, of William Morris, finding it
charming as a poet's essay in prose but no more: not to be ranked
with the highest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE DRAMA</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>Biologists tell us that the hybrid&mdash;the product of a
variety of ancestral stocks&mdash;is more fertile than an organism
with a direct and unmixed ancestry; perhaps the analogy is not too
fanciful as the starting-point of a study of Elizabethan drama,
which owed its strength and vitality, more than to anything else,
to the variety of the discordant and contradictory elements of
which it was made up. The drama was the form into which were
moulded the thoughts and desires of the best spirits of the time.
It was the flower of the age. To appreciate its many-sided
significances and achievements it is necessary to disentangle
carefully its roots, in religion, in the revival of the classics,
in popular entertainments, in imports from abroad, in the air of
enterprise and adventure which belonged to the time.</p>
<p>As in Greece, drama in England was in its beginning a religious
thing. Its oldest continuous tradition was from the mediaeval
Church. Early in the Middle Ages the clergy and their parishioners
began the habit, at Christmas, Easter and other holy days, of
playing some part of the story of Christ's life suitable to the
festival of the day. These plays were liturgical, and originally,
no doubt, overshadowed by a choral element. But gradually the
inherent human capacity for mimicry and drama took the upper hand;
from ceremonies they developed into performances; they passed from
the stage in the church porch to the stage in the street. A waggon,
the natural human platform for mimicry or oratory, became in
England as it was in Greece, the cradle of the drama. This
momentous change in the history of the miracle play, which made it
in all but its occasion and its subject a secular thing, took place
about the end of the twelfth century. The rise of the town guilds
gave the plays a new character; the friendly rivalry of leagued
craftsmen elaborated their production; and at length elaborate
cycles were founded which were performed at Whitsuntide, beginning
at sunrise and lasting all through the day right on to dusk. Each
town had its own cycle, and of these the cycles of York, Wakefield,
Chester and Coventry still remain. So too, does an eye-witness's
account of a Chester performance where the plays took place yearly
on three days, beginning with Whit Monday. "The manner of these
plays were, every company had his pageant or part, a high scaffold
with two rooms, a higher and a lower, upon four wheels. In the
lower they apparelled themselves and in the higher room they
played, being all open on the top that all beholders might hear and
see them. They began first at the abbey gates, and when the first
pageant was played, it was wheeled to the high cross before the
mayor and so to every street. So every street had a pageant playing
upon it at one time, till all the pageants for the day appointed
were played." The "companies" were the town guilds and the several
"pageants" different scenes in Old or New Testament story. As far
as was possible each company took for its pageant some Bible story
fitting to its trade; in York the goldsmiths played the three Kings
of the East bringing precious gifts, the fishmongers the flood, and
the shipwrights the building of Noah's ark. The tone of these plays
was not reverent; reverence after all implies near at hand its
opposite in unbelief. But they were realistic and they contained
within them the seeds of later drama in the aptitude with which
they grafted into the sacred story pastoral and city manners taken
straight from life. The shepherds who watched by night at Bethlehem
were real English shepherds furnished with boisterous and realistic
comic relief. Noah was a real shipwright.</p>

<p>Cain and Abel were English farmers just as truly as Bottom and
his fellows were English craftsmen. But then Julius Caesar has a
doublet and in Dutch pictures the apostles wear broad-brimmed hats.
Squeamishness about historical accuracy is of a later date, and
when it came we gained in correctness less than we lost in art.</p>
<p>The miracle plays, then, are the oldest antecedent of
Elizabethan drama, but it must not be supposed they were over and
done with before the great age began. The description of the
Chester performances, part of which has been quoted, was written in
1594. Shakespeare must, one would think, have seen the Coventry
cycle; at any rate he was familiar, as every one of the time must
have been, with the performances; "Out-heroding Herod" bears
witness to that. One must conceive the development of the
Elizabethan age as something so rapid in its accessibility to new
impressions and new manners and learning and modes of thought that
for years the old and new subsisted side by side. Think of modern
Japan, a welter of old faiths and crafts and ideals and inrushing
Western civilization all mixed up and side by side in the strangest
contrasts and you will understand what it was. The miracle plays
stayed on beside Marlowe and Shakespeare till Puritanism frowned
upon them. But when the end came it came quickly. The last recorded
performance took place in London when King James entertained
Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador. And perhaps we should regard that
as a "command" performance, reviving as command performances
commonly do, something dead for a generation&mdash;in this case,
purely out of compliment to the faith and inclination of a
distinguished guest.</p>
<p>Next in order of development after the miracle or mystery plays,
though contemporary in their popularity, came what we called
"moralities" or "moral interludes"&mdash;pieces designed to enforce
a religious or ethical lesson and perhaps to get back into drama
something of the edification which realism had ousted from the
miracles. They dealt in allegorical and figurative personages,
expounded wise saws and moral lessons, and squared rather with the
careful self-concern of the newly established Protestantism than
with the frank and joyous jest in life which was more
characteristic of the time. <cite>Everyman</cite>, the oftenest
revived and best known of them, if not the best, is very typical of
the class. They had their influences, less profound than that of
the miracles, on the full drama. It is said the
"Vice"&mdash;unregeneracy commonly degenerated into comic
relief&mdash;is the ancestor of the fool in Shakespeare, but more
likely both are successive creations of a dynasty of actors who
practised the unchanging and immemorial art of the clown. The
general structure of <cite>Everyman</cite> and some of its fellows,
heightened and made more dramatic, gave us Marlowe's
<cite>Faustus</cite>. There perhaps the influence ends.</p>
<p>The rise of a professional class of actors brought one step
nearer the full growth of drama. Companies of strolling players
formed themselves and passed from town to town, seeking like the
industrious amateurs of the guilds, civic patronage, and performing
in town-halls, market-place booths, or inn yards, whichever served
them best. The structure of the Elizabethan inn yard (you may see
some survivals still, and there are the pictures in
<cite>Pickwick</cite>) was very favourable for their purpose. The
galleries round it made seats like our boxes and circle for the
more privileged spectators; in the centre on the floor of the yard
stood the crowd or sat, if they had stools with them. The stage was
a platform set on this floor space with its back against one side
of the yard, where perhaps one of the inn-rooms served as a
dressing room. So suitable was this "fit-up" as actors call it,
that when theatres came to be built in London they were built on
the inn-yard pattern. All the playhouses of the Bankside from the
"Curtain" to the "Globe" were square or circular places with
galleries rising above one another three parts round, a floor space
of beaten earth open to the sky in the middle, and jutting out on
to it a platform stage with a tiring room capped by a gallery
behind it.</p>
<p>The entertainment given by these companies of players (who
usually got the patronage and took the title of some lord) was
various. They played moralities and interludes, they played
formless chronicle history plays like the <cite>Troublesome Reign
of King John</cite>, on which Shakespeare worked for his <cite>King
John</cite>; but above and before all they were each a company of
specialists, every one of whom had his own talent and performance
for which he was admired. The Elizabethan stage was the ancestor of
our music-hall, and to the modern music-hall rather than to the
theatre it bears its affinity. If you wish to realize the aspect of
the Globe or the Blackfriars it is to a lower class music-hall you
must go. The quality of the audience is a point of agreement. The
Globe was frequented by young "bloods" and by the more disreputable
portions of the community, racing men (or their equivalents of that
day) "coney catchers" and the like; commonly the only women present
were women of the town. The similarity extends from the auditorium
to the stage. The Elizabethan playgoer delighted in virtuosity; in
exhibitions of strength or skill from his actors; the broad sword
combat in <cite>Macbeth</cite>, and the wrestling in <cite>As You
Like It</cite>, were real trials of skill. The bear in the
<cite>Winter's Tale</cite> was no doubt a real bear got from a bear
pit, near by in the Bankside. The comic actors especially were the
very grandfathers of our music-hall stars; Tarleton and Kemp and
Cowley, the chief of them, were as much popular favourites and
esteemed as separate from the plays they played in as is Harry
Lauder. Their songs and tunes were printed and sold in hundreds as
broadsheets, just as pirated music-hall songs are sold to-day. This
is to be noted because it explains a great deal in the subsequent
evolution of the drama. It explains the delight in having
everything represented actually on the stage, all murders, battles,
duels. It explains the magnificent largesse given by Shakespeare to
the professional fool. Work had to be found for him, and
Shakespeare, whose difficulties were stepping-stones to his
triumphs, gave him Touchstone and Feste, the Porter in
<cite>Macbeth</cite> and the Fool in <cite>Lear</cite>. Others met
the problem in an attitude of frank despair. Not all great tragic
writers can easily or gracefully wield the pen of comedy, and
Marlowe in <cite>Dr. Faustus</cite> took the course of leaving the
low comedy which the audience loved and a high salaried actor
demanded, to an inferior collaborator.</p>
<p>Alongside this drama of street platforms and inn-yards and
public theatres, there grew another which, blending with it,
produced the Elizabethan drama which we know. The public theatres
were not the only places at which plays were produced. At the
University, at the Inns of Court (which then more than now, were
besides centres of study rather exclusive and expensive clubs), and
at the Court they were an important part of almost every festival.
At these places were produced academic compositions, either
allegorical like the masques, copies of which we find in
Shakespeare and by Ben Jonson, or comedies modelled on Plautus or
Terence, or tragedies modelled on Seneca. The last were
incomparably the most important. The Elizabethan age, which always
thought of literature as a guide or handmaid to life, was naturally
attracted to a poet who dealt in maxims and "sentences"; his
rhetoric appealed to men for whom words and great passages of verse
were an intoxication that only a few to-day can understand or
sympathize with; his bloodthirstiness and gloom to an age so
full-blooded as not to shrink from horrors. Tragedies early began
to be written on the strictly Senecan model, and generally, like
Seneca's, with some ulterior intention. Sackville's
<cite>Gorboduc</cite>, the first tragedy in English, produced at a
great festival at the Inner Temple, aimed at inducing Elizabeth to
marry and save the miseries of a disputed succession. To be put to
such a use argues the importance and dignity of this classical
tragedy of the learned societies and the court. None of the pieces
composed in this style were written for the popular theatre, and
indeed they could not have been a success on it. The Elizabethan
audience, as we have seen, loved action, and in these Senecan
tragedies the action took place "off." But they had a strong and
abiding influence on the popular stage; they gave it its ghosts,
its supernatural warnings, its conception of nemesis and revenge,
they gave it its love of introspection and the long passages in
which introspection, description or reflection, either in soliloquy
or dialogue, holds up the action; contradictorily enough they gave
it something at least of its melodrama. Perhaps they helped to
enforce the lesson of the miracle plays that a dramatist's proper
business was elaboration rather than invention. None of the
Elizabethan dramatists except Ben Jonson habitually constructed
their own plots. Their method was to take something ready at their
hands and overlay it with realism or poetry or romance. The stories
of their plays, like that of Hamlet's Mousetrap, were "extant and
writ in choice Italian," and very often their methods of
preparation were very like his.</p>
<p>Something of the way in which the spirit of adventure of the
time affected and finished the drama we have already seen. It is
time now to turn to the dramatists themselves.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>Of Marlowe, Kyd, Greene, and Peele, the "University Wits" who
fused the academic and the popular drama, and by giving the latter
a sense of literature and learning to mould it to finer issues,
gave us Shakespeare, only Marlowe can be treated here. Greene and
Peele, the former by his comedies, the latter by his historical
plays, and Kyd by his tragedies, have their places in the
text-books, but they belong to a secondary order of dramatic
talent. Marlowe ranks amongst the greatest. It is not merely that
historically he is the head and fount of the whole movement, that
he changed blank verse, which had been a lumbering instrument
before him, into something rich and ringing and rapid and made it
the vehicle for the greatest English poetry after him. Historical
relations apart, he is great in himself. More than any other
English writer of any age, except Byron, he symbolizes the youth of
his time; its hot-bloodedness, its lust after knowledge and power
and life inspires all his pages. The teaching of Machiavelli,
misunderstood for their own purposes by would-be imitators,
furnished the reign of Elizabeth with the only political ideals it
possessed. The simple brutalism of the creed, with means justified
by ends and the unbridled self-regarding pursuit of power,
attracted men for whom the Spanish monarchy and the struggle to
overthrow it were the main factors and politics. Marlowe took it
and turned it to his own uses. There is in his writings a lust of
power, "a hunger and thirst after unrighteousness," a glow of the
imagination unhallowed by anything but its own energy which is in
the spirit of the time. In <cite>Tamburlaine</cite> it is the power
of conquest, stirred by and reflecting, as we have seen, the great
deeds of his day. In <cite>Dr. Faustus</cite> it is the pride of
will and eagerness of curiosity. Faustus is devoured by a
tormenting desire to enlarge his knowledge to the utmost bounds of
nature and art and to extend his power with his knowledge. His is
the spirit of Renaissance scholarship heightened to a passionate
excess. The play gleams with the pride of learning and a knowledge
which learning brings, and with the nemesis that comes after it.
"Oh! gentlemen! hear me with patience and tremble not at my
speeches. Though my heart pant and quiver to remember that I have
been a student here these thirty years; oh! I would I had never
seen Wittemburg, never read book!" And after the agonizing struggle
in which Faustus's soul is torn from him to hell, learning comes in
at the quiet close.</p>
<div class="poem">
<p class="i4">"Yet, for he was a scholar once admired,</p>
<p class="i2">For wondrous knowledge in our German Schools;</p>
<p class="i4">We'll give his mangled limbs due burial;</p>
<p class="i2">And all the students, clothed in mourning black</p>
<p class="i4">Shall wait upon his heavy funeral."</p>
</div>
<p>Some one character is a centre of over-mastering pride and
ambition in every play. In the <cite>Jew of Malta</cite> it is the
hero Barabbas. In <cite>Edward II</cite>. it is Piers Gaveston. In
<cite>Edward II</cite>. indeed, two elements are mixed&mdash;the
element of Machiavelli and Tamburlaine in Gaveston, and the purely
tragic element which evolves from within itself the style in which
it shall be treated, in the King. "The reluctant pangs of
abdicating Royalty," wrote Charles Lamb in a famous passage,
"furnished hints which Shakespeare scarcely improved in his
<cite>Richard II</cite>; and the death scene of Marlowe's King
moves pity and terror beyond any scene, ancient or modern, with
which I am acquainted." Perhaps the play gives the hint of what
Marlowe might have become had not the dagger of a groom in a tavern
cut short at thirty his burning career.</p>
<p>Even in that time of romance and daring speculation he went
further than his fellows. He was said to have been tainted with
atheism, to have denied God and the Trinity; had he lived he might
have had trouble with the Star Chamber. The free-voyaging intellect
of the age found this one way of outlet, but if literary evidences
are to be trusted sixteenth and seventeenth century atheism was a
very crude business. The <cite>Atheist's Tragedy</cite> of Tourneur
(a dramatist who need not otherwise detain us) gives some measure
of its intelligence and depth. Says the villain to the heroine,</p>
<div class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">"No? Then
invoke</span><br>
Your great supposed Protector. I will do't."</div>
<br>
to which she:<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Supposed Protector! Are you an atheist, then<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I know my fears and prayers are
spent in vain."</span></div>
<p>Marlowe's very faults and extravagances, and they are many, are
only the obverse of his greatness. Magnitude and splendour of
language when the thought is too shrunken to fill it out, becomes
mere inflation. He was a butt of the parodists of the day. And
Shakespeare, though he honoured him "on this side idolatry," did
his share of ridicule. Ancient Pistol is fed and stuffed with relic
and rags of Marlowesque affectation&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">"Holla! ye pampered jades of Asia,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Can ye not draw but twenty miles
a day."</span></div>
<br>
is a quotation taken straight from <cite>Tamburlaine</cite>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>A study of Shakespeare, who refuses to be crushed within the
limits of a general essay is no part of the plan of this book. We
must take up the story of the drama with the reign of James and
with the contemporaries of his later period, though of course, a
treatment which is conditioned by the order of development is not
strictly chronological, and some of the plays we shall have to
refer to belong to the close of the sixteenth century. We are apt
to forget that alongside Shakespeare and at his heels other
dramatists were supplying material for the theatre. The influence
of Marlowe and particularly of Kyd, whose <cite>Spanish
Tragedy</cite> with its crude mechanism of ghosts and madness and
revenge caught the popular taste, worked itself out in a score of
journeymen dramatists, mere hack writers, who turned their hand to
plays as the hacks of to-day turn their hand to novels, and with no
more literary merit than that caught as an echo from better men
than themselves. One of the worst of these&mdash;he is also one of
the most typical&mdash;was John Marston, a purveyor of tragic gloom
and sardonic satire, and an impostor in both, whose tragedy
<cite>Antonio and Mellida</cite> was published in the same year as
Shakespeare's <cite>Hamlet</cite>. Both plays owed their style and
plot to the same tradition&mdash;the tradition created by Kyd's
<cite>Spanish Tragedy</cite>&mdash;in which ghostly promptings to
revenge, terrible crime, and a feigned madman waiting his
opportunity are the elements of tragedy. Nothing could be more
fruitful in an understanding of the relations of Shakespeare to his
age than a comparison of the two. The style of <cite>Antonio and
Mellida</cite> is the style of <cite>The Murder of Gonzago</cite>.
There is no subtlety nor introspection, the pale cast of thought
falls with no shadow over its scenes. And it is typical of a score
of plays of the kind we have and beyond doubt of hundreds that have
perished. Shakespeare stands alone.</p>
<p>Beside this journey-work tragedy of revenge and murder which had
its root through Kyd and Marlowe in Seneca and in Italian romance,
there was a journey-work comedy of low life made up of loosely
constructed strings of incidents, buffoonery and romance, that had
its roots in a joyous and fantastic study of the common people.
These plays are happy and high-spirited and, compared with the
ordinary run of the tragedies, of better workmanship. They deal in
the familiar situations of low comedy&mdash;the clown, the thrifty
citizen and his frivolous wife, the gallant, the bawd, the good
apprentice and the bad portrayed vigorously and tersely and with a
careless kindly gaiety that still charms in the reading. The best
writers in this kind were Middleton and Dekker&mdash;and the best
play to read as a sample of it <cite>Eastward Ho!</cite> in which
Marston put off his affectation of sardonical melancholy and joined
with Jonson and Dekker to produce what is the masterpiece of the
non-Shakespearean comedy of the time.</p>
<p>For all our habit of grouping their works together it is a far
cry in spirit and temperament from the dramatists whose heyday was
under Elizabeth and those who reached their prime under her
successor. Quickly though insensibly the temper of the nation
suffered eclipse. The high hopes and the ardency of the reign of
Elizabeth saddened into a profound pessimism and gloom in that of
James. This apparition of unsought melancholy has been widely noted
and generally assumed to be inexplicable. In broad outline its
causes are clear enough, "To travel hopefully is a better thing
than to arrive." The Elizabethans were, if ever any were, hopeful
travellers. The winds blew them to the four quarters of the world;
they navigated all seas; they sacked rich cities. They beat off the
great Armada, and harried the very coasts of Spain. They pushed
discovery to the ends of the world and amassed great wealth. Under
James all these things were over. Peace was made with Spain:
national pride was wounded by the solicitous anxiety of the King
for a Spanish marriage for the heir to the throne. Sir Walter
Raleigh, a romantic adventurer lingering beyond his time, was
beheaded out of hand by the ungenerous timidity of the monarch to
whom had been transferred devotion and loyalty he was unfitted to
receive. The Court which had been a centre of flashing and gleaming
brilliance degenerated into a knot of sycophants humouring the
pragmatic and self-important folly of a king in whom had implanted
themselves all the vices of the Scots and none of their virtues.
Nothing seemed left remarkable beneath the visiting moon. The
bright day was done and they were for the dark. The uprising of
Puritanism and the shadow of impending religious strife darkened
the temper of the time.</p>
<p>The change affected all literature and particularly the drama,
which because it appeals to what all men have in common, commonly
reflects soonest a change in the outlook or spirits of a people.
The onslaughts of the dramatists on the Puritans, always implacable
enemies of the theatre, became more virulent and envenomed. What a
difference between the sunny satire of Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the
dark animosity of <cite>The Atheists' Tragedy</cite> with its
Languebeau Snuffe ready to carry out any villainy proposed to him!
"I speak sir," says a lady in the same play to a courtier who
played with her in an attempt to carry on a quick witted,
"conceited" love passage in the vein of <cite>Much Ado</cite>, "I
speak, sir, as the fashion now: is, in earnest." The quick-witted,
light-hearted age was gone. It is natural that tragedy reflected
this melancholy in its deepest form. Gloom deepened and had no
light to relieve it, men supped full of horrors&mdash;there was no
slackening of the tension, no concession to overwrought nerves, no
resting-place for the overwrought soul. It is in the dramatist John
Webster that this new spirit has its most powerful exponent.</p>
<p>The influence of Machiavelli, which had given Marlowe tragic
figures that were bright and splendid and burning, smouldered in
Webster into a duskier and intenser heat. His fame rests on two
tragedies, <cite>The White Devil</cite> and <cite>The Duchess of
Malf</cite>. Both are stories of lust and crime, full of hate and
hideous vengeances, and through each runs a vein of bitter and
ironical comment on men and women. In them chance plays the part of
fate. "Blind accident and blundering mishap&mdash;'such a mistake,'
says one of the criminals, 'as I have often seen in a play' are the
steersmen of their fortunes and the doomsmen of their deeds." His
characters are gloomy; meditative and philosophic murderers,
cynical informers, sad and loving women, and they are all
themselves in every phrase that they utter. But they are studied in
earnestness and sincerity. Unquestionably he is the greatest of
Shakespeare's successors in the romantic drama, perhaps his only
direct imitator. He has single lines worthy to set beside those in
<cite>Othello</cite> or <cite>King Lear</cite>. His dirge in the
<cite>Duchess of Malfi</cite>, Charles Lamb thought worthy to be
set beside the ditty in <cite>The Tempest</cite>, which reminds
Ferdinand of his drowned father. "As that is of the water, watery,
so this is of the earth, earthy." He has earned his place among the
greatest of our dramatists by his two plays, the theme of which
matched his sombre genius and the sombreness of the season in which
it flowered.</p>
<p>But the drama could not survive long the altered times, and the
voluminous plays of Beaumont and Fletcher mark the beginning of the
end. They are the decadence of Elizabethan drama. Decadence is a
term often used loosely and therefore hard to define, but we may
say broadly that an art is decadent when any particular one of the
elements which go to its making occurs in excess and disturbs the
balance of forces which keeps the work a coherent and intact whole.
Poetry is decadent when the sound is allowed to outrun the sense or
when the suggestions, say, of colour, which it contains are allowed
to crowd out its deeper implications. Thus we can call such a poem
as this one well-known of O'Shaughnessy's</p>
<div class="poem">"We are the music-makers,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We are the dreamers of
dreams,"</span></div>
<br>
decadent because it conveys nothing but the mere delight in an
obvious rhythm of words, or such a poem as Morris's "Two red roses
across the moon;" because a meaningless refrain, merely pleasing in
its word texture, breaks in at intervals on the reader. The drama
of Beaumont and Fletcher is decadent in two ways. In the first
place those variations and licences with which Shakespeare in his
later plays diversified the blank verse handed on to him by
Marlowe, they use without any restraint or measure. "Weak" endings
and "double" endings, <em>i.e.</em> lines which end either on a
conjunction or proposition or some other unstressed word, or lines
in which there is a syllable too many&mdash;abound in their plays.
They destroyed blank verse as a musical and resonant poetic
instrument by letting this element of variety outrun the sparing
and skilful use which alone could justify it. But they were
decadent in other and deeper ways than that. Sentiment in their
plays usurps the place of character. Eloquent and moving speeches
and fine figures are no longer subservient to the presentation of
character in action, but are set down for their own sake, "What
strange self-trumpeters and tongue-bullies all the brave soldiers
of Beaumont and Fletcher are," said Coleridge. When they die they
die to the music of their own virtue. When dreadful deeds are done
they are described not with that authentic and lurid vividness
which throws light on the working of the human heart in Shakespeare
or Webster but in tedious rhetoric. Resignation, not fortitude, is
the authors' forte and they play upon it amazingly. The sterner
tones of their predecessors melt into the long drawn broken accent
of pathos and woe. This delight not in action or in emotion arising
from action but in passivity of suffering is only one aspect of a
certain mental flaccidity in grain. Shakespeare may be free and
even coarse. Beaumont and Fletcher cultivate indecency. They made
their subject not their master but their plaything, or an occasion
for the convenient exercise of their own powers of figure and
rhetoric.<br>
<br>
<p>Of their followers, Massinger, Ford and Shirley, no more need be
said than they carried one step further the faults of their
masters. Emotion and tragic passion give way to wire-drawn
sentiment. Tragedy takes on the air of a masquerade. With them
romantic drama died a natural death and the Puritans' closing of
the theatre only gave it a <em>coup de grace</em>. In England it
has had no second birth.</p>
<br>
<h4>(4)</h4>
<p>Outside the direct romantic succession there worked another
author whose lack of sympathy with it, as well as his close
connection with the age which followed, justifies his separate
treatment. Ben Jonson shows a marked contrast to Shakespeare in his
character, his accomplishments, and his attitude to letters, while
his career was more varied than Shakespeare's own. The first
"classic" in English writing, he was a "romantic" in action. In his
adventurous youth he was by turns scholar, soldier, bricklayer,
actor. He trailed a pike with Leicester in the Low Countries; on
his return to England fought a duel and killed his man, only
escaping hanging by benefit of clergy; at the end of his life he
was Poet Laureate. Such a career is sufficiently diversified, and
it forms a striking contrast to the plainness and severity of his
work. But it must not lead us to forget or under-estimate his
learning and knowledge. Not Gray nor Tennyson, nor
Swinburne&mdash;perhaps not even Milton&mdash;was a better scholar.
He is one of the earliest of English writers to hold and express
different theories about literature. He consciously appointed
himself a teacher; was a missionary of literature with a definite
creed.</p>
<p>But though in a general way his dramatic principles are opposed
to the romantic tendencies of his age, he is by no means blindly
classical. He never consented to be bound by the
"Unities"&mdash;that conception of dramatic construction evolved
out of Aristotle and Horace and elaborated in the Renaissance till,
in its strictest form, it laid down that the whole scene of a play
should be in one place, its whole action deal with one single
series of events, and the time it represented as elapsing be no
greater than the time it took in playing. He was always
pre-eminently an Englishman of his own day with a scholar's rather
than a poet's temper, hating extravagance, hating bombast and cant,
and only limited because in ruling out these things he ruled out
much else that was essential to the spirit of the time. As a
craftsman he was uncompromising; he never bowed to the tastes of
the public and never veiled his scorn of those&mdash;Shakespeare
among them&mdash;whom he conceived to do so; but he knew and valued
his own work, as his famous last word to an audience who might be
unsympathetic stands to witness,</p>
<div class="poem">"By God 'tis good, and if you like it you
may."</div>
<p>Compare the temper it reveals with the titles of the two
contemporary comedies of his gentler and greater brother, the one
<cite>As You Like It</cite>, the other <cite>What You Will</cite>.
Of the two attitudes towards the public, and they might stand as
typical of two kinds of artists, neither perhaps can claim complete
sincerity. A truculent and noisy disclaimer of their favours is not
a bad tone to assume towards an audience; in the end it is apt to
succeed as well as the sub-ironical compliance which is its
opposite.</p>
<p>Jonson's theory of comedy and the consciousness with which he
set it against the practice of his contemporaries and particularly
of Shakespeare receive explicit statement in the prologue to
<cite>Every Man Out of His Humour</cite>&mdash;one of his earlier
plays. "I travail with another objection, Signor, which I fear will
be enforced against the author ere I can be delivered of it," says
Mitis. "What's that, sir?" replies Cordatus. Mitis:&mdash;"That the
argument of his comedy might have been of some other nature, as of
a duke to be in love with a countess, and that countess to be in
love with the duke's son, and the son to love the lady's waiting
maid; some such cross-wooing, better than to be thus near and
familiarly allied to the times." Cordatus: "You say well, but I
would fain hear one of these autumn-judgments define <em>Quin sit
comoedia</em>? If he cannot, let him concern himself with Cicero's
definition, till he have strength to propose to himself a better,
who would have a comedy to be <em>invitatio vitae, speculum
consuetudinis, imago veritatis</em>; a thing throughout pleasant
and ridiculous and accommodated to the correction of manners." That
was what he meant his comedy to be, and so he conceived the popular
comedy of the day, <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> and <cite>Much
Ado</cite>. Shakespeare might play with dukes and countesses,
serving-women and pages, clowns and disguises; he would come down
more near and ally himself familiarly with the times. So comedy was
to be medicinal, to purge contemporary London of its follies and
its sins; and it was to be constructed with regularity and
elaboration, respectful to the Unities if not ruled by them, and
built up of characters each the embodiment of some "humour" or
eccentricity, and each when his eccentricity is displaying itself
at its fullest, outwitted and exposed. This conception of
"humours," based on a physiology which was already obsolescent,
takes heavily from the realism of Jonson's methods, nor does his
use of a careful vocabulary of contemporary colloquialism and slang
save him from a certain dryness and tediousness to modern readers.
The truth is he was less a satirist of contemporary manners than a
satirist in the abstract who followed the models of classical
writers in this style, and he found the vices and follies of his
own day hardly adequate to the intricacy and elaborateness of the
plots which he constructed for their exposure. At the first glance
his people are contemporary types, at the second they betray
themselves for what they are really&mdash;cock-shies set up by the
new comedy of Greece that every "classical" satirist in Rome or
France or England has had his shot at since. One wonders whether
Ben Jonson, for all his satirical intention, had as much
observation&mdash;as much of an eye for contemporary types&mdash;as
Shakespeare's rustics and roysterers prove him to have had. It
follows that all but one or two of his plays, when they are put on
the stage to-day are apt to come to one with a sense of remoteness
and other-worldliness which we hardly feel with Shakespeare or
Moli&egrave;re. His muse moves along the high-road of comedy which
is the Roman road, and she carries in her train types that have
done service to many since the ancients fashioned them years ago.
Jealous husbands, foolish pragmatic fathers, a dissolute son, a
boastful soldier, a cunning slave&mdash;they all are merely
counters by which the game of comedy used to be played. In England,
since Shakespeare took his hold on the stage, that road has been
stopped for us, that game has ceased to amuse.</p>
<p>Ben Jonson, then, in a certain degree failed in his intention.
Had he kept closer to contemporary life, instead of merely grafting
on to it types he had learned from books, he might have made
himself an English Moli&egrave;re&mdash;without Moli&egrave;re's
breadth and clarity&mdash;but with a corresponding vigour and
strength which would have kept his work sweet. And he might have
founded a school of comedy that would have got its roots deeper
into our national life than the trivial and licentious Restoration
comedy ever succeeded in doing. As it is, his importance is mostly
historical. One must credit him with being the first of the English
classics&mdash;of the age which gave us Dryden and Swift and Pope.
Perhaps that is enough in his praise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<br>
<h3>THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>With the seventeenth century the great school of imaginative
writers that made glorious the last years of Elizabeth's reign, had
passed away. Spenser was dead before 1600, Sir Philip Sidney a
dozen years earlier, and though Shakespeare and Drayton and many
other men whom we class roughly as Elizabethan lived on to work
under James, their temper and their ideals belong to the earlier
day. The seventeenth century, not in England only but in Europe,
brought a new way of thinking with it, and gave a new direction to
human interest and to human affairs. It is not perhaps easy to
define nor is it visible in the greater writers of the time.
Milton, for instance, and Sir Thomas Browne are both of them too
big, and in their genius too far separated from their fellows to
give us much clue to altered conditions. It is commonly in the work
of lesser and forgotten writers that the spirit of an age has its
fullest expression. Genius is a law to itself; it moves in another
dimension; it is out of time. To define this seventeenth century
spirit, then, one must look at the literature of the age as a
whole. What is there that one finds in it which marks a change in
temperament and outlook from the Renaissance, and the time which
immediately followed it?</p>
<p>Putting it very broadly one may say that literature in the
seventeenth century becomes for the first time essentially modern
in spirit. We began our survey of modern English literature at the
Renaissance because the discovery of the New World, and the
widening of human experience and knowledge, which that and the
revival of classical learning implied, mark a definite break from a
way of thought which had been continuous since the break up of the
Roman Empire. The men of the Renaissance felt themselves to be
modern. They started afresh, owing nothing to their immediate
forbears, and when they talked, say, of Chaucer, they did so in
very much the same accent as we do to-day. He was mediaeval and
obsolete; the interest which he possessed was a purely literary
interest; his readers did not meet him easily on the same plane of
thought, or forget the lapse of time which separated him from them.
And in another way too, the Renaissance began modern writing.
Inflections had been dropped. The revival of the classics had
enriched our vocabulary, and the English language, after a gradual
impoverishment which followed the obsolescence one after another of
the local dialects, attained a fairly fixed form. There is more
difference between the language of the English writings of Sir
Thomas More and that of the prose of Chaucer than there is between
that of More and of Ruskin. But it is not till the seventeenth
century that the modern spirit, in the fullest sense of the word,
comes into being. Defined it means a spirit of observation, of
preoccupation with detail, of stress laid on matter of fact, of
analysis of feelings and mental processes, of free argument upon
institutions and government. In relation to knowledge, it is the
spirit of science, and the study of science, which is the essential
intellectual fact in modern history, dates from just this time,
from Bacon and Newton and Descartes. In relation to literature, it
is the spirit of criticism, and criticism in England is the
creation of the seventeenth century. The positive temper, the
attitude of realism, is everywhere in the ascendant. The sixteenth
century made voyages of discovery; the seventeenth sat down to take
stock of the riches it had gathered. For the first time in English
literature writing becomes a vehicle for storing and conveying
facts.</p>
<p>It would be easy to give instances: one must suffice here.
Biography, which is one of the most characteristic kinds of English
writing, was unknown to the moderns as late as the sixteenth
century. Partly the awakened interest in the careers of the ancient
statesmen and soldiers which the study of Plutarch had excited, and
partly the general interest in, and craving for, facts set men
writing down the lives of their fellows. The earliest English
biographies date from this time. In the beginning they were
concerned, like Plutarch, with men of action, and when Sir Fulke
Greville wrote a brief account of his friend Sir Philip Sidney it
was the courtier and the soldier, and not the author, that he
designed to celebrate. But soon men of letters came within their
scope, and though the interest in the lives of authors came too
late to give us the contemporary life of Shakespeare we so much
long for, it was early enough to make possible those masterpieces
of condensed biography in which Isaak Walton celebrates Herbert and
Donne. Fuller and Aubrey, to name only two authors, spent lives of
laborious industry in hunting down and chronicling the smallest
facts about the worthies of their day and the time immediately
before them. Autobiography followed where biography led. Lord
Herbert of Cherbury and Margaret Duchess of Newcastle, as well as
less reputable persons, followed the new mode. By the time of the
Restoration Pepys and Evelyn were keeping their diaries, and Fox
his journal. Just as in poetry the lyric, that is the expression of
personal feeling, became more widely practised, more subtle and
more sincere, in prose the letter, the journal, and the
autobiography formed themselves to meet the new and growing demand
for analysis of the feelings and the intimate thoughts and
sensations of real men and women. A minor form of literature which
had a brief but popular vogue ministered less directly to the same
need. The "Character," a brief descriptive essay on a contemporary
type&mdash;a tobacco seller, an old college butler or the
like&mdash;was popular because in its own way it matched the newly
awakened taste for realism and fact. The drama which in the hands
of Ben Jonson had attacked folly and wickedness proper to no place
or time, descended to the drawing-rooms of the day, and Congreve
occupied himself with the portrayal of the social frauds and
foolishnesses perpetrated by actual living men and women of fashion
in contemporary London. Satire ceased to be a mere expression of a
vague discontent, and became a weapon against opposing men and
policies. The new generation of readers were nothing if not
critical. They were for testing directly institutions whether they
were literary, social, or political. They wanted facts, and they
wanted to take a side.</p>
<p>In the distinct and separate realm of poetry a revolution no
less remarkable took place. Spenser had been both a poet and a
Puritan: he had designed to show by his great poem the training and
fashioning of a Puritan English gentleman. But the alliance between
poetry and Puritanism which he typified failed to survive his
death. The essentially pagan spirit of the Renaissance which caused
him no doubts nor difficulties proved too strong for his readers
and his followers, and the emancipated artistic enthusiasm in which
it worked alienated from secular poetry men with deep and strong
religious convictions. Religion and morality and poetry, which in
Sidney and Spenser had gone hand in hand, separated from each
other. Poems like <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite> or like
Shakespeare's sonnets could hardly be squared with the sterner
temper which persecution began to breed. Even within orthodox
Anglicanism poetry and religion began to be deemed no fit company
for each other. When George Herbert left off courtier and took
orders he burnt his earlier love poetry, and only the persuasion of
his friends prevented Donne from following the same course. Pure
poetry became more and more an exotic. All Milton's belongs to his
earlier youth; his middle age was occupied with controversy and
propaganda in prose; when he returned to poetry in blindness and
old age it was "to justify the ways of God to man"&mdash;to use
poetry, that is, for a spiritual and moral rather than an artistic
end.</p>
<p>Though the age was curious and inquiring, though poetry and
prose tended more and more to be enlisted in the service of
non-artistic enthusiasms and to be made the vehicle of deeper
emotions and interests than perhaps a northern people could ever
find in art, pure and simple, it was not like the time that
followed it, a "prosaic" age. Enthusiasm burned fierce and clear,
displaying itself in the passionate polemic of Milton, in the
fanaticism of Bunyan and Fox, hardly more than in the gentle,
steadfast search for knowledge in Burton, and the wide and vigilant
curiousness of Bacon. Its eager experimentalism tried the
impossible; wrote poems and then gave them a weight of meaning they
could not carry, as when Fletcher in <cite>The Purple Island</cite>
designed to allegorize all that the physiology of his day knew of
the human body, or Donne sought to convey abstruse scientific fact
in a lyric. It gave men a passion for pure learning, set Jonson to
turn himself from a bricklayer into the best equipped scholar of
his day, and Fuller and Camden grubbing among English records and
gathering for the first time materials of scientific value for
English history. Enthusiasm gave us poetry that was at once full of
learning and of imagination, poetry that was harsh and brutal in
its roughness and at the same time impassioned. And it set up a
school of prose that combined colloquial readiness and fluency,
pregnancy and high sentiment with a cumbrous pedantry of learning
which was the fruit of its own excess.</p>
<p>The form in which enthusiasm manifested itself most fiercely was
as we have seen not favourable to literature. Puritanism drove
itself like a wedge into the art of the time, broadening as it
went. Had there been no more in it than the moral earnestness and
religiousness of Sidney and Spenser, Cavalier would not have
differed from Roundhead, and there might have been no civil war;
each party was endowed deeply with the religious sense and Charles
I. was a sincerely pious man. But while Spenser and Sidney held
that life as a preparation for eternity must be ordered and
strenuous and devout but that care for the hereafter was not
incompatible with a frank and full enjoyment of life as it is
lived, Puritanism as it developed in the middle classes became a
sterner and darker creed. The doctrine of original sin, face to
face with the fact that art, like other pleasures, was naturally
and readily entered into and enjoyed, forced them to the plain
conclusion that art was an evil thing. As early as Shakespeare's
youth they had been strong enough to keep the theatres outside
London walls; at the time of the Civil War they closed them
altogether, and the feud which had lasted for over a generation
between them and the dramatists ended in the destruction of the
literary drama. In the brief years of their ascendancy they
produced no literature, for Milton is much too large to be tied
down to their negative creed, and, indeed, in many of his
qualities, his love of music and his sensuousness for instance, he
is antagonistic to the temper of his day. With the Restoration
their earnest and strenuous spirit fled to America. It is
noteworthy that it had no literary manifestation there till two
centuries after the time of its passage. Hawthorne's novels are the
fruit&mdash;the one ripe fruit in art&mdash;of the Puritan
imagination.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>If the reader adopts the seventeenth century habit himself and
takes stock of what the Elizabethans accomplished in poetry, he
will recognize speedily that their work reached various stages of
completeness. They perfected the poetic drama and its instrument,
blank verse; they perfected, though not in the severer Italian
form, the sonnet; they wrote with extraordinary delicacy and finish
short lyrics in which a simple and freer manner drawn from the
classics took the place of the mediaeval intricacies of the ballad
and the rondeau. And in the forms which they failed to bring to
perfection they did beautiful and noble work. The splendour of
<cite>The Fairy Queen</cite> is in separate passages; as a whole it
is over tortuous and slow; its affectations, its sensuousness, the
mere difficulty of reading it, makes us feel it a collection of
great passages, strung it is true on a large conception, rather
than a great work. The Elizabethans, that is, had not discovered
the secret of the long poem; the abstract idea of the "heroic" epic
which was in all their minds had to wait for embodiment till
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. In a way their treatment of the
pastoral or eclogue form was imperfect too. They used it well but
not so well as their models, Vergil and Theocritus; they had not
quite mastered the convention on which it is built.</p>
<p>The seventeenth century, taking stock in some such fashion of
its artistic possessions, found some things it were vain to try to
do. It could add nothing to the accomplishment of the English
sonnet, so it hardly tried; with the exception of a few sonnets in
the Italian form of Milton, the century can show us nothing in this
mode of verse. The literary drama was brought to perfection in the
early years of it by the surviving Elizabethans; later decades
could add nothing to it but licence, and as we saw, the licences
they added hastened its destruction. But in other forms the poets
of the new time experimented eagerly, and in the stress of
experiment, poetry which under Elizabeth had been integral and
coherent split into different schools. As the period of the
Renaissance was also that of the Reformation it was only natural a
determined effort should sooner or later be made to use poetry for
religious purposes. The earliest English hymn writing, our first
devotional verse in the vernacular, belongs to this time, and a
Catholic and religious school of lyricism grew and flourished
beside the pagan neo-classical writers. From the tumult of
experiment three schools disengage themselves, the school of
Spenser, the school of Jonson, and the school of Donne.</p>
<p>At the outset of the century Spenser's influence was triumphant
and predominant; his was the main stream with which the other
poetic influences of the time merely mingled. His popularity is
referable to qualities other than those which belonged peculiarly
to his talent as a poet. Puritans loved his religious ardour, and
in those Puritan households where the stricter conception of the
diabolical nature of all poetry had not penetrated, his works were
read&mdash;standing on a shelf, may be, between the new translation
of the Bible and Sylvester's translation of the French poet Du
Bartas' work on the creation, that had a large popularity at that
time as family reading. Probably the Puritans were as blind to the
sensuousness of Spenser's language and imagery as they were (and
are) to the same qualities in the Bible itself. <cite>The Fairy
Queen</cite> would easily achieve innocuousness amongst those who
can find nothing but an allegory of the Church in the "Song of
Songs." His followers made their allegory a great deal plainer than
he had done his. In his poem called <cite>The Purple Island</cite>,
Phineas Fletcher, a Puritan imitator of Spenser in Cambridge,
essayed to set forth the struggle of the soul at grip with evil, a
battle in which the body&mdash;the "Purple Island"&mdash;is the
field. To a modern reader it is a desolating and at times a mildly
amusing book, in which everything from the liver to the seven
deadly sins is personified; in which after four books of
allegorized contemporary anatomy and physiology, the will (Voletta)
engages in a struggle with Satan and conquers by the help of Christ
and King James! The allegory is clever&mdash;too clever&mdash;and
the author can paint a pleasant picture, but on the whole he was
happier in his pastoral work. His brother Giles made a better
attempt at the Spenserian manner. His long poem, <cite>Christ's
Victory and Death</cite>, shows for all its carefully Protestant
tone high qualities of mysticism; across it Spenser and Milton join
hands.</p>
<p>It was, however, in pastoral poetry that Spenser's influence
found its pleasantest outlet. One might hesitate to advise a reader
to embark on either of the Fletchers. There is no reason why any
modern should not read and enjoy Browne or Wither, in whose softly
flowing verse the sweetness and contentment of the countryside,
that "merry England" which was the background of all sectarian and
intellectual strife and labour, finds as in a placid stream a calm
reflection and picture of itself. The seventeenth century gave
birth to many things that only came to maturity in the nineteenth;
if you care for that kind of literary study which searches out
origins and digs for hints and models of accented styles, you will
find in Browne that which influenced more than any other single
thing the early work of Keats. Browne has another claim to
immortality; if it be true as is now thought that he was the author
of the epitaph on the Countess of Pembroke:</p>
<div class="poem">"Underneath this sable hearse<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lies the subject of all
verse,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sidney's sister, Pembroke's
mother.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Death, ere thou hast slain
another</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fair and learned and good as
she,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Time shall throw a dart at
thee."</span></div>
<br>
then he achieved the miracle of a quintessential statement of the
spirit of the English Renaissance. For the breath of it stirs in
these slow quiet moving lines, and its few and simple words
implicate the soul of a period.<br>
<br>
<p>By the end of the first quarter of the century the influence of
Spenser and the school which worked under it had died out. Its
place was taken by the twin schools of Jonson and Donne. Jonson's
poetic method is something like his dramatic; he formed himself as
exactly as possible on classical models. Horace had written satires
and elegies, and epistles and complimentary verses, and Jonson
quite consciously and deliberately followed where Horace led. He
wrote elegies on the great, letters and courtly compliments and
love-lyrics to his friends, satires with an air of general censure.
But though he was classical, his style was never latinized. In all
of them he strove to pour into an ancient form language that was as
intense and vigorous and as purely English as the earliest
trumpeters of the Renaissance in England could have wished. The
result is not entirely successful. He seldom fails to reproduce
classic dignity and good sense; on the other hand he seldom
succeeds in achieving classic grace and ease. Occasionally, as in
his best known lyric, he is perfect and achieves an air of
spontaneity little short of marvellous, when we know that his
images and even his words in the song are all plagiarized from
other men. His expression is always clear and vigorous and his
sense good and noble. The native earnestness and sincerity of the
man shines through as it does in his dramas and his prose. In an
age of fantastic and meaningless eulogy&mdash;eulogy so amazing in
its unexpectedness and abstruseness that the wonder is not so much
that it should have been written as that it could have been thought
of&mdash;Jonson maintains his personal dignity and his good sense.
You feel his compliments are such as the best should be, not
necessarily understood and properly valued by the public, but of a
discriminating sort that by their very comprehending sincerity
would be most warmly appreciated by the people to whom they were
addressed. His verses to Shakespeare and his prose commentaries on
him too, are models of what self-respecting admiration should be,
generous in its praise of excellence, candid in its statement of
defects. They are the kind of compliments that Shakespeare himself,
if he had grace enough, must have loved to receive.</p>
<p>Very different from his direct and dignified manner is the
closely packed style of Donne, who, Milton apart, is the greatest
English writer of the century, though his obscurity has kept him
out of general reading. No poetry in English, not even Browning, is
more difficult to understand. The obscurity of Donne and Browning
proceed from such similar causes that they are worth examining
together. In both, as in the obscure passages in Shakespeare's
later plays, obscurity arises not because the poet says too little
but because he attempts to say too much. He huddles a new thought
on the one before it, before the first has had time to express
itself; he sees things or analyses emotions so swiftly and subtly
himself that he forgets the slower comprehensions of his readers;
he is for analysing things far deeper than the ordinary mind
commonly can. His wide and curious knowledge finds terms and
likenesses to express his meaning unknown to us; he sees things
from a dozen points of view at once and tumbles a hint of each
separate vision in a heap out on to the page; his restless
intellect finds new and subtler shades of emotion and thought
invisible to other pairs of eyes, and cannot, because speech is
modelled on the average of our intelligences, find words to express
them; he is always trembling on the brink of the inarticulate. All
this applies to both Donne and Browning, and the comparison could
be pushed further still. Both draw the knowledge which is the main
cause of their obscurity from the same source, the bypaths of
mediaevalism. Browning's <cite>Sordello</cite> is obscure because
he knows too much about mediaeval Italian history; Donne's
<cite>Anniversary</cite> because he is too deeply read in mediaeval
scholasticism and speculation. Both make themselves more difficult
to the reader who is familiar with the poetry of their
contemporaries by the disconcerting freshness of their point of
view. Seventeenth century love poetry was idyllic and idealist;
Donne's is passionate and realistic to the point of cynicism. To
read him after reading Browne or Jonson is to have the same shock
as reading Browning after Tennyson. Both poets are salutary in the
strong and biting antidote they bring to sentimentalism in thought
and melodious facility in writing. They are the corrective of lazy
thinking and lazy composition.</p>
<p>Elizabethan love poetry was written on a convention which though
it was used with manliness and entire sincerity by Sidney did not
escape the fate of its kind. Dante's love for Beatrice, Petrarch's
for Laura, the gallant and passionate adoration of Sidney for his
Stella became the models for a dismal succession of imaginary woes.
They were all figments of the mind, perhaps hardly that; they all
use the same terms and write in fixed strains, epicurean and
sensuous like Ronsard, ideal and intellectualized like Dante,
sentimental and adoring like Petrarch. Into this enclosed garden of
sentiment and illusion Donne burst passionately and rudely, pulling
up the gay-coloured tangled weeds that choked thoughts, planting,
as one of his followers said, the seeds of fresh invention. Where
his forerunners had been idealist, epicurean, or adoring, he was
brutal, cynical and immitigably realist. He could begin a poem,
"For God's sake hold your tongue and let me live"; he could be as
resolutely free from illusion as Shakespeare when he addressed his
Dark Lady&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">"Hope not for mind in women; at their best,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sweetness and wit they're but
mummy possest."</span></div>
<p>And where the sonneteers pretended to a sincerity which was none
of theirs, he was, like Browning, unaffectedly a dramatic lyrist.
"I did best," he said, "when I had least truth for my subject."</p>
<p>His love poetry was written in his turbulent and brilliant
youth, and the poetic talent which made it turned in his later
years to express itself in hymns and religious poetry. But there is
no essential distinction between the two halves of his work. It is
all of a piece. The same swift and subtle spirit which analyses
experiences of passion, analyses, in his later poetry, those of
religion. His devotional poems, though they probe and question, are
none the less never sermons, but rather confessions or prayers. His
intense individuality, eager always, as his best critic has said,
"to find a North-West passage of his own,"[<a href="#note-2">2</a>]
pressed its curious and sceptical questioning into every corner of
love and life and religion, explored unsuspected depths, exploited
new discovered paradoxes, and turned its discoveries always into
poetry of the closely-packed artificial style which was all its own.
Simplicity indeed would have been for him an affectation; his
elaborateness is not like that of his followers, constructed
painfully in a vicious desire to compass the unexpected, but the
natural overflow of an amazingly fertile and ingenious mind. The
curiosity, the desire for truth, the search after minute and
detailed knowledge of his age is all in his verse. He bears the
spirit of his time not less markedly than Bacon does, or Newton, or
Descartes.</p>
<p>The work of the followers of Donne and Jonson leads straight to
the new school, Jonson's by giving that school a model on which to
work, Donne's by producing an era of extravagance and absurdity
which made a literary revolution imperative. The school of
Donne&mdash;the "fantastics" as they have been called (Dr. Johnson
called them the metaphysical poets), produced in Herbert and
Vaughan, our two noblest writers of religious verse, the flower of
a mode of writing which ended in the somewhat exotic religiousness
of Crashaw. In the hands of Cowley the use of far-sought and
intricate imagery became a trick, and the fantastic school, the
soul of sincerity gone out of it, died when he died. To the
followers of Jonson we owe that delightful and simple lyric poetry
which fills our anthologies, their courtly lyricism receiving a new
impulse in the intenser loyalty of troubled times. The most
finished of them is perhaps Carew; the best, because of the
freshness and varity of his subject-matter and his easy grace,
Herrick. At the end of them came Waller and gave to the
five-accented rhymed verse (the heroic couplet) that trick of
regularity and balance which gave us the classical school.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>The prose literature of the seventeenth century is
extraordinarily rich and varied, and a study of it would cover a
wide field of human knowledge. The new and unsuspected harmonies
discovered by the Elizabethans were applied indeed to all the tasks
of which prose is capable, from telling stories to setting down the
results of speculation which was revolutionizing science and
philosophy. For the first time the vernacular and not Latin became
the language of scientific research, and though Bacon in his
<cite>Novum Organum</cite> adhered to the older mode its
disappearance was rapid. English was proving itself too flexible an
instrument for conveying ideas to be longer neglected. It was
applied too to preaching of a more formal and grandiose kind than
the plain and homely Latimer ever dreamed of. The preachers, though
their golden-mouthed oratory, which blended in its combination of
vigour and cadence the euphuistic and colloquial styles of the
Elizabethans, is in itself a glory of English literature, belong by
their matter too exclusively to the province of Church history to
be dealt with here. The men of science and philosophy, Newton,
Hobbes, and Locke, are in a like way outside our province. For the
purpose of the literary student the achievement of the seventeenth
century can be judged in four separate men or books&mdash;in the
Bible, in Francis Bacon, and in Burton and Browne.</p>
<p>In a way the Bible, like the preachers, lies outside the domain
of literary study in the narrow sense; but its sheer literary
magnitude, the abiding significance of it in our subsequent
history, social, political, and artistic as well as religious,
compel us to turn aside to examine the causes that have produced
such great results. The Authorized Version is not, of course, a
purely seventeenth century work. Though the scholars[<a href=
"#note-3">3</a>] who wrote and compiled it had before them all the
previous vernacular texts and chose the best readings where they
found them or devised new ones in accordance with the original, the
basis is undoubtedly the Tudor version of Tindall. It has, none the
less, the qualities of the time of its publication. It could hardly
have been done earlier; had it been so, it would not have been done
half so well. In it English has lost both its roughness and its
affectation and retained its strength; the Bible is the supreme
example of early English prose style. The reason is not far to
seek. Of all recipes for good or noble writing that which enjoins
the writer to be careful about the matter and never mind the
manner, is the most sure. The translators had the handling of
matter of the gravest dignity and momentousness, and their sense of
reverence kept them right in their treatment of it. They cared
passionately for the truth; they were virtually anonymous and not
ambitious of originality or literary fame; they had no desire to
stand between the book and its readers. It followed that they
cultivated that naked plainness and spareness which makes their
work supreme. The Authorized Version is the last and greatest of
those English translations which were the fruit of Renaissance
scholarship and pioneering. It is the first and greatest piece of
English prose.</p>
<p>Its influence is one of those things on which it is profitless
to comment or enlarge simply because they are an understood part of
every man's experience. In its own time it helped to weld England,
for where before one Bible was read at home and another in
churches, all now read the new version. Its supremacy was
instantaneous and unchallenged, and it quickly coloured speech and
literature; it could produce a Bunyan in the century of its birth.
To it belongs the native dignity and eloquence of peasant speech.
It runs like a golden thread through all our writing subsequent to
its coming; men so diverse as Huxley and Carlyle have paid their
tribute to its power; Ruskin counted it the one essential part of
its education. It will be a bad day for the mere quality of our
language when it ceases to be read.</p>
<p>At the time the translators were sitting, Francis Bacon was at
the height of his fame. By profession a lawyer&mdash;time-serving
and over-compliant to wealth and influence&mdash;he gives
singularly little evidence of it in the style of his books.
Lawyers, from the necessity they are under of exerting persuasion,
of planting an unfamiliar argument in the minds of hearers of whose
favour they are doubtful, but whose sympathy they must gain, are
usually of purpose diffuse. They cultivate the gift, possessed by
Edmund Burke above all other English authors, of putting the same
thing freshly and in different forms a great many times in
succession. They value copiousness and fertility of illustration.
Nothing could be more unlike this normal legal manner than the
style of Bacon. "No man," says Ben Jonson, speaking in one of those
vivid little notes of his, of his oratorical method, "no man ever
coughed or turned aside from him without loss." He is a master of
the aphoristic style. He compresses his wisdom into the
quintessential form of an epigram; so complete and concentrated is
his form of statement, so shortly is everything put, that the mere
transition from one thought to another gives his prose a curious
air of disjointedness as if he flitted arbitrarily from one thing
to another, and jotted down anything that came into his head. His
writing has clarity and lucidity, it abounds in terseness of
expression and in exact and discriminating phraseology, and in the
minor arts of composition&mdash;in the use of quotations for
instance&mdash;it can be extraordinarily felicitous. But it lacks
spaciousness and ease and rhythm; it makes too inexorable a demand
on the attention, and the harassed reader soon finds himself
longing for those breathing spaces which consideration or perhaps
looseness of thought has implanted in the prose of other
writers.</p>
<p>His <cite>Essays</cite>, the work by which he is best known,
were in their origin merely jottings gradually cohered and enlarged
into the series we know. In them he had the advantage of a subject
which he had studied closely through life. He counted himself a
master in the art of managing men, and "Human Nature and how to
manage it" would be a good title for his book. Men are studied in
the spirit of Machiavelli, whose philosophy of government appealed
so powerfully to the Elizabethan mind. Taken together the essays
which deal with public matters are in effect a kind of manual for
statesmen and princes, instructing them how to acquire power and
how to keep it, deliberating how far they may go safely in the
direction of self-interest, and to what degree the principle of
self-interest must be subordinated to the wider interests of the
people who are ruled. Democracy, which in England was to make its
splendid beginnings in the seventeenth century, finds little to
foretell it in the works of Bacon. Though he never advocates
cruelty or oppression and is wise enough to see that no statesman
can entirely set aside moral considerations, his ethical tone is
hardly elevating; the moral obliquity of his public life is to a
certain extent explained, in all but its grosser elements, in his
published writings. The essays, of course, contain much more than
this; the spirit of curious and restless enquiry which animated
Bacon finds expression in those on "Health," or "Gardens" and
"Plantations" and others of the kind; and a deeper vein of
earnestness runs through some of them&mdash;those for instance on
"Friendship," or "Truth" and on "Death."</p>
<p>The <cite>Essays</cite> sum up in a condensed form the
intellectual interests which find larger treatment in his other
works. His <cite>Henry VII.</cite>, the first piece of scientific
history in the English language (indeed in the modern world) is
concerned with a king whose practice was the outcome of a political
theory identical with Bacon's own. The <cite>Advancement of
Learning</cite> is a brilliant popular exposition of the cause of
scientific enquiry and of the inductive or investigatory method of
research. The <cite>New Atlantis</cite> is the picture of an ideal
community whose common purpose is scientific investigation. Bacon's
name is not upon the roll of those who have enlarged by brilliant
conjectures or discoveries the store of human knowledge; his own
investigations so far as they are recorded are all of a trivial
nature. The truth about him is that he was a brilliantly clever
populariser of the cause of science, a kind of seventeenth century
Huxley, concerned rather to lay down large general principles for
the guidance of the work of others, than to be a serious worker
himself. The superstition of later times, acting on and refracting
his amazing intellectual gifts, has raised him to a godlike
eminence which is by right none of his; it has even credited him
with the authorship of Shakespeare, and in its wilder moments with
the composition of all that is of supreme worth in Elizabethan
literature. It is not necessary to take these delusions seriously.
The ignorance of mediaevalism was in the habit of crediting Vergil
with the construction of the Roman aqueducts and temples whose
ruins are scattered over Europe. The modern Baconians reach much
the same intellectual level.</p>
<p>A similar enthusiasm for knowledge and at any rate a pretence to
science belong to the author of the <cite>Anatomy of
Melancholy</cite>, Robert Burton. His one book is surely the most
amazing in English prose. Its professed object was simple and
comprehensive; it was to analyze human melancholy, to describe its
effects, and prescribe for its removal. But as his task grew,
melancholy came to mean to Burton all the ills that flesh is heir
to. He tracked it in obscure and unsuspected forms; drew
illustrations from a range of authors so much wider than the
compass of the reading of even the most learned since, that he is
generally credited with the invention of a large part of his
quotations. Ancients and moderns, poets and prose writers,
schoolmen and dramatists are all drawn upon for the copious store
of his examples; they are always cited with an air of quietly
humorous shrewdness in the comments and enclosed in a prose that is
straightforward, simple and vigorous, and can on occasion command
both rhythm and beauty of phrase. It is a mistake to regard Burton
from the point of view (due largely to Charles Lamb) of tolerant or
loving delight in quaintness for quaintness' sake. His book is
anything but scientific in form, but it is far from being the work
of a recluse or a fool. Behind his lack of system, he takes a broad
and psychologically an essentially just view of human ills, and
modern medicine has gone far in its admiration of what is at bottom
a most comprehensive and subtle treatise in diagnosis.</p>
<p>A writer of a very different quality is Sir Thomas Browne. Of
all the men of his time, he is the only one of whom one can say for
certain that he held the manner of saying a thing more important
than the thing said. He is our first deliberate and conscious
stylist, the forerunner of Charles Lamb, of Stevenson (whose
<cite>Virginibus Puerisque</cite> is modelled on his method of
treatment) and of the stylistic school of our own day. His
eloquence is too studied to rise to the greatest heights, and his
speculation, though curious and discursive, never really results in
deep thinking. He is content to embroider his pattern out of the
stray fancies of an imaginative nature. His best known work, the
<cite>Religio Medici</cite>, is a random confession of belief and
thoughts, full of the inconsequent speculations of a man with some
knowledge of science but not deeply or earnestly interested about
it, content rather to follow the wayward imaginations of a mind
naturally gifted with a certain poetic quality, than to engage in
serious intellectual exercise. Such work could never maintain its
hold on taste if it were not carefully finished and constructed
with elaborate care. Browne, if he was not a great writer, was a
literary artist of a high quality. He exploits a quaint and lovable
egoism with extraordinary skill; and though his delicately figured
and latinized sentences commonly sound platitudinous and trivial
when they are translated into rough Saxon prose, as they stand they
are rich and melodious enough.</p>
<br>
<h4>(4)</h4>
<p>In a century of surpassing richness in prose and poetry, one
author stands by himself. John Milton refuses to be classed with
any of the schools. Though Dryden tells us Milton confessed to him
that Spenser was his "original," he has no connection&mdash;other
than a general similarity of purpose, moral and
religious&mdash;with Spenser's followers. To the fantastics he paid
in his youth the doubtful compliment of one or two
half-contemptuous imitations and never touched them again. He had
no turn for the love lyrics or the courtliness of the school of
Jonson. In everything he did he was himself and his own master; he
devised his own subjects and wrote his own style. He stands alone
and must be judged alone.</p>
<p>No author, however, can ever escape from the influences of his
time, and, just as much as his lesser contemporaries, Milton has
his place in literary history and derives from the great original
impulse which set in motion all the enterprises of the century. He
is the last and greatest figure in the English Renaissance. The new
passion for art and letters which in its earnest fumbling
beginnings gave us the prose of Cheke and Ascham and the poetry of
Surrey and Sackville, comes to a full and splendid and perfect end
in his work. In it the Renaissance and the Reformation, imperfectly
fused by Sidney and Spenser, blend in their just proportions. The
transplantation into English of classical forms which had been the
aim of Sidney and the endeavour of Jonson he finally accomplished;
in his work the dream of all the poets of the Renaissance&mdash;the
heroic poem&mdash;finds its fulfilment. There was no poet of the
time but wanted to do for his country what Vergil had planned to do
for Rome, to sing its origins, and to celebrate its morality and
its citizenship in the epic form. Spenser had tried it in <cite>The
Fairy Queen</cite> and failed splendidly. Where he failed, Milton
succeeded, though his poem is not on the origins of England but on
the ultimate subject of the origins of mankind. We know from his
notebooks that he turned over in his mind a national subject and
that the Arthurian legend for a while appealed to him. But to
Milton's earnest temper nothing that was not true was a fit subject
for poetry. It was inevitable he should lay it aside. The Arthurian
story he knew to be a myth and a myth was a lie; the story of the
Fall, on the other hand, he accepted in common with his time for
literal fact. It is to be noted as characteristic of his confident
and assured egotism that he accepted no less sincerely and
literally the imaginative structure which he himself reared on it.
However that may be, the solid fact about him is that in this
"adventurous song" with its pursuit of</p>
<div class="poem">"Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,"</div>
<br>
he succeeded in his attempt, that alone among the moderns he
contrived to write an epic which stands on the same eminence as the
ancient writings of the kind, and that he found time in a life,
which hardly extended to old age as we know it, to write, besides
noble lyrics and a series of fiercely argumentative prose
treatises, two other masterpieces in the grand style, a tragedy
modelled on the Greeks and a second epic on the "compact" style of
the book of Job. No English poet can compare with him in majesty or
completeness.<br>
<br>
<p>An adequate study of his achievement is impossible within the
limits of the few pages that are all a book like this can spare to
a single author. Readers who desire it will find it in the work of
his two best critics, Mark Pattison and Sir Walter
Raleigh.[<a href="#note-4">4</a>] All that can be done here is to
call attention to some of his most striking qualities. Foremost, of
course, is the temper of the man. From the beginning he was sure of
himself and sure of his mission; he had his purpose plain and
clear. There is no mental development, hardly, visible in his work,
only training, undertaken anxiously and prayerfully and with a
clearly conceived end. He designed to write a masterpiece and he
would not start till he was ready. The first twenty years of his
life were spent in assiduous reading; for twenty more he was
immersed in the dust and toil of political conflict, using his pen
and his extraordinary equipment of learning and eloquence to defend
the cause of liberty, civil and religious, and to attack its
enemies; not till he was past middle age had he reached the leisure
and the preparedness necessary to accomplish his self-imposed work.
But all the time, as we know, he had it in his mind. In
<cite>Lycidas</cite>, written in his Cambridge days, he apologizes
to his readers for plucking the fruit of his poetry before it is
ripe. In passage after passage in his prose works he begs for his
reader's patience for a little while longer till his preparation be
complete. When the time came at last for beginning he was in no
doubt; in his very opening lines he intends, he says, to soar no
"middle flight." This self-assured unrelenting certainty of his,
carried into his prose essays in argument, produces sometimes
strange results. One is peculiarly interesting to us now in view of
current controversy. He was unhappily married, and because he was
unhappy the law of divorce must be changed. A modern&mdash;George
Eliot for instance&mdash;would have pleaded the artistic
temperament and been content to remain outside the law. Milton
always argued from himself to mankind at large.</p>
<p>In everything he did, he put forth all his strength. Each of his
poems, long or short, is by itself a perfect whole, wrought
complete. The reader always must feel that the planning of each is
the work of conscious, deliberate, and selecting art. Milton never
digresses; he never violates harmony of sound or sense; his poems
have all their regular movement from quiet beginning through a
rising and breaking wave of passion and splendour to quiet close.
His art is nowhere better seen than in his endings.</p>
<p>Is it <cite>Lycidas</cite>? After the thunder of approaching
vengeance on the hireling shepherds of the Church, comes sunset and
quiet:</p>
<div class="poem">"And now the sun had stretch'd out all the
hills,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And now was dropt into the
western bay;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At last he rose, and twitched his
mantle blue:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To-morrow to fresh woods and
pastures new."</span></div>
<p>Is it <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>? After the agonies of expulsion
and the flaming sword&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">"Some natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them
soon;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The world was all before them
where to choose</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their place of rest, and
Providence their guide;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They hand in hand with wandering
steps and slow,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Through Eden took their solitary
way."</span></div>
<p>Is it finally <cite>Samson Agonistes</cite>?</p>
<div class="poem">"His servants he with new acquist,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of true experience from this
great event,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With peace and consolation hath
dismist,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And calm of mind all passion
spent."</span></div>
<p>"Calm of mind, all passion spent," it is the essence of Milton's
art.</p>
<p>He worked in large ideas and painted splendid canvases; it was
necessary for him to invent a style which should be capable of
sustained and lofty dignity, which should be ornate enough to
maintain the interest of the reader and charm him and at the same
time not so ornate as to give an air of meretricious decoration to
what was largely and simply conceived. Particularly it was
necessary for him to avoid those incursions of vulgar associations
which words carelessly used will bring in their train. He succeeded
brilliantly in this difficult task. The unit of the Miltonic style
is not the phrase but the word, each word fastidiously chosen,
commonly with some air of an original and lost meaning about it,
and all set in a verse in which he contrived by an artful variation
of pause and stress to give the variety which other writers had
from rhyme. In this as in his structure he accomplished what the
Renaissance had only dreamed. Though he had imitators (the poetic
diction of the age following is modelled on him) he had no
followers. No one has been big enough to find his secret since.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<br>
<h3>THE AGE OF GOOD SENSE</h3>
<p>The student of literature, when he passes in his reading from
the age of Shakespeare and Milton to that of Dryden and Pope, will
be conscious of certain sharply defined differences between the
temper and styles of the writers of the two periods. If besides
being a student of literature he is also (for this is a different
thing) a student of literary criticism he will find that these
differences have led to the affixing of certain labels&mdash;that
the school to which writers of the former period belong is called
"Romantic" and that of the latter "Classic," this "Classic" school
being again overthrown towards the end of the eighteenth century by
a set of writers who unlike the Elizabethans gave the name
"Romantic" to themselves. What is he to understand by these two
labels; what are the characteristics of "Classicism" and how far is
it opposite to and conflicting with "Romanticism"? The question is
difficult because the names are used vaguely and they do not
adequately cover everything that is commonly put under them. It
would be difficult, for instance, to find anything in Ben Jonson
which proclaims him as belonging to a different school from Dryden,
and perhaps the same could be said in the second and self-styled
period of Romanticism of the work of Crabbe. But in the main the
differences are real and easily visible, even though they hardly
convince us that the names chosen are the happiest that could be
found by way of description.</p>
<p>This period of Dryden and Pope on which we are now entering
sometimes styled itself the Augustan Age of English poetry. It
grounded its claim to classicism on a fancied resemblance to the
Roman poets of the golden age of Latin poetry, the reign of the
Emperor Augustus. Its authors saw themselves each as a second
Vergil, a second Ovid, most of all a second Horace, and they
believed that their relation to the big world, their assured
position in society, heightened the resemblances. They endeavoured
to form their poetry on the lines laid down in the critical writing
of the original Augustan age as elaborated and interpreted in
Renaissance criticism. It was tacitly assumed&mdash;some of them
openly asserted it&mdash;that the kinds, modes of treatment and all
the minor details of literature, figures of speech, use of epithets
and the rest, had been settled by the ancients once and for all.
What the Greeks began the critics and authors of the time of
Augustus had settled in its completed form, and the scholars of the
Renaissance had only interpreted their findings for modern use.
There was the tragedy, which had certain proper parts and a certain
fixed order of treatment laid down for it; there was the heroic
poem, which had a story or "fable," which must be treated in a
certain fixed manner, and so on. The authors of the "Classic"
period so christened themselves because they observed these rules.
And they fancied that they had the temper of the Augustan
time&mdash;the temper displayed in the works of Horace more than in
those of any one else&mdash;its urbanity, its love of good sense
and moderation, its instinctive distrust of emotion, and its
invincible good breeding. If you had asked them to state as simply
and broadly as possible their purpose they would have said it was
to follow nature, and if you had enquired what they meant by nature
it would turn out that they thought of it mainly as the opposite of
art and the negation of what was fantastic, tortured, or far sought
in thinking or writing. The later "Romantic" Revival, when it
called itself a return to nature, was only claiming the intention
which the classical school itself had proclaimed as its main
endeavour. The explanation of that paradox we shall see presently;
in the meantime it is worth looking at some of the characteristics
of classicism as they appear in the work of the "Classic"
authors.</p>
<p>In the first place the "Classic" writers aimed at simplicity of
style, at a normal standard of writing. They were intolerant of
individual eccentricities; they endeavoured, and with success, to
infuse into English letters something of the academic spirit that
was already controlling their fellow-craftsmen in France. For this
end amongst others they and the men of science founded the Royal
Society, an academic committee which has been restricted since to
the physical and natural sciences and been supplemented by similar
bodies representing literature and learning only in our own day.
Clearness, plainness, conversational ease and directness were the
aims the society set before its members where their writing was
concerned. "The Royal Society," wrote the Bishop of Rochester, its
first historian, "have exacted from all their members a close,
naked, natural way of speaking; positive expressions, clear sense,
a native easiness, bringing all things as near the mathematical
plainness as they can; and preferring the language of artisans,
countrymen, and merchants before that of wits and scholars."
Artisans, countrymen, and merchants&mdash;the ideal had been
already accepted in France, Malesherbes striving to use no word
that was not in the vocabulary of the day labourers of Paris,
Moli&egrave;re making his washerwoman first critic of his comedies.
It meant for England the disuse of the turgidities and involutions
which had marked the prose of the preachers and moralists of the
times of James and Charles I.; scholars and men of letters were
arising who would have taken John Bunyan, the unlettered tinker of
Bedford, for their model rather than the learned physician Sir
Thomas Browne.</p>
<p>But genius like Bunyan's apart, there is nothing in the world
more difficult than to write with the easy and forthright
simplicity of talk, as any one may see who tries for
himself&mdash;or even compares the letter-writing with the
conversation of his friends. So that this desire of simplicity, of
clarity, of lucidity led at once to a more deliberate art. Dryden
and Swift and Addison were assiduous in their labour with the file;
they excel all their predecessors in polish as much as the writers
of the first Augustan age excelled theirs in the same quality. Not
that it was all the result of deliberate art; in a way it was in
the air, and quite unlearned people&mdash;journalists and
pamphleteers and the like who wrote unconsciously and hurriedly to
buy their supper&mdash;partook of it as well as leisured people and
conscious artists. Defoe is as plain and easy and polished as
Swift, yet it is certain his amazing activity and productiveness
never permitted him to look back over a sentence he had written.
Something had happened, that is, to the English language. The
assimilation of latinisms and the revival of obsolete terms of
speech had ceased; it had become finally a more or less fixed form,
shedding so much of its imports as it had failed to make part of
itself and acquiring a grammatical and syntactical fixity which it
had not possessed in Elizabethan times. When Shakespeare wrote</p>
<div class="poem">"What cares these roarers for the name of
king,"</div>
<br>
he was using, as students of his language never tire of pointing
out to us, a perfectly correct local grammatical form. Fifty years
after that line was written, at the Restoration, local forms had
dropped out of written English. We had acquired a normal standard
of language, and either genius or labour was polishing it for
literary uses.<br>
<br>
<p>What they did for prose these "Classic" writers did even more
exactly&mdash;and less happily&mdash;for verse. Fashions often
become exaggerated before their disappearance, and the decadence of
Elizabethan romanticism had produced poetry the wildness and
extravagance of whose images was well-nigh unbounded. The passion
for intricate and far-sought metaphor which had possessed Donne was
accompanied in his work and even more in that of his followers with
a passion for what was elusive and recondite in thought and emotion
and with an increasing habit of rudeness and wilful difficultness
in language and versification. Against these ultimate licences of a
great artistic period, the classical writers invoked the qualities
of smoothness and lucidity, in the same way, so they fancied, as
Vergil might have invoked them against Lucretius. In the treatment
of thought and feeling they wanted clearness, they wanted ideas
which the mass of men would readily apprehend and assent to, and
they wanted not hints or half-spoken suggestions but complete
statement. In the place of the logical subtleties which Donne and
his school had sought in the scholastic writers of the Middle Ages,
they brought back the typically Renaissance study of rhetoric; the
characteristic of all the poetry of the period is that it has a
rhetorical quality. It is never intimate and never profound, but it
has point and wit, and it appeals with confidence to the balanced
judgment which men who distrust emotion and have no patience with
subtleties intellectual, emotional, or merely verbal, have in
common. Alongside of this lucidity, this air of complete statement
in substance they strove for and achieved smoothness in form. To
the poet Waller, the immediate predecessor of Dryden, the classical
writers themselves ascribed the honour of the innovation. In fact
Waller was only carrying out the ideals counselled and followed by
Ben Jonson. It was in the school of Waller and Dryden and not in
that of the minor writers who called themselves his followers that
he came to his own.</p>
<p>What then are the main differences between classicism of the
best period&mdash;the classicism whose characteristics we have been
describing&mdash;and the Romanticism which came before and after?
In the first place we must put the quality we have described as
that of complete statement. Classical poetry is, so to speak, "all
there." Its meaning is all of it on the surface; it conveys nothing
but what it says, and what it says, it says completely. It is
always vigorous and direct, often pointed and aphoristic, never
merely suggestive, never given to half statement, and never
obscure. You feel that as an instrument of expression it is sharp
and polished and shining; it is always bright and defined in
detail. The Great Romantics go to work in other ways. Their poetry
is a thing of half lights and half spoken suggestions, of hints
that imagination will piece together, of words that are charged
with an added meaning of sound over sense, a thing that stirs the
vague and impalpable restlessness of memory or terror or desire
that lies down beneath in the minds of men. It rouses what a
philosopher has called the "Transcendental feeling," the solemn
sense of the immediate presence of "that which was and is and ever
shall be," to induce which is the property of the highest poetry.
You will find nothing in classical poetry so poignant or highly
wrought as Webster's</p>
<div class="poem">"Cover her face; mine eyes dazzle; she died
young,"</div>
<br>
and the answer,<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"I think not so: her infelicity<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Seemed to have years too
many,"</span></div>
<br>
or so subtle in its suggestion, sense echoing back to primeval
terrors and despairs, as this from <cite>Macbeth</cite>:<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Stones have been known to move and trees to
speak;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Augurs and understood relations
have</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By magot-pies, and choughs, and
rooks brought forth</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The secret'st man of
blood."</span></div>
<br>
or so intoxicating to the imagination and the senses as an ode of
Keats or a sonnet by Rossetti. But you will find eloquent and
pointed statements of thoughts and feelings that are common to most
of us&mdash;the expression of ordinary human nature&mdash;<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"What oft was thought but ne'er so well
exprest,"</div>
<p>"Wit and fine writing" consisting, as Addison put it in a review
of Pope's first published poem, not so much "in advancing things
that are new, as in giving things that are known an agreeable
turn."</p>
<p>Though in this largest sense the "classic" writers eschewed the
vagueness of romanticism, in another and more restricted way they
cultivated it. They were not realists as all good romanticists have
to be. They had no love for oddities or idiosyncrasies or
exceptions. They loved uniformity, they had no use for truth in
detail. They liked the broad generalised, descriptive style of
Milton, for instance, better than the closely packed style of
Shakespeare, which gets its effects from a series of minute
observations huddled one after the other and giving the reader, so
to speak, the materials for his own impression, rather than
rendering, as does Milton, the expression itself.</p>
<p>Every literary discovery hardens ultimately into a convention;
it has its day and then its work is done, and it has to be
destroyed so that the ascending spirit of humanity can find a
better means of self-expression. Out of the writing which aimed at
simplicity and truth to nature grew "Poetic Diction," a special
treasury of words and phrases deemed suitable for poetry, providing
poets with a common stock of imagery, removing from them the
necessity of seeing life and nature each one for himself. The
poetry which Dryden and Pope wrought out of their mental vigour,
their followers wrote to pattern. Poetry became reduced, as it
never was before and has never been since, to a formula. The
Elizabethan sonneteers, as we saw, used a vocabulary and
phraseology in common with their fellows in Italy and France, and
none the less produced fine poetry. But they used it to express
things they really felt. The truth is it is not the fact of a
poetic diction which matters so much as its quality&mdash;whether
it squares with sincerity, whether it is capable of expressing
powerfully and directly one's deepest feelings. The history of
literature can show poetic dictions&mdash;special vocabularies and
forms for poetry&mdash;that have these qualities; the diction, for
instance, of the Greek choruses, or of the Scottish poets who
followed Chaucer, or of the troubadours. That of the classic
writers of an Augustan age was not of such a kind. Words clothe
thought; poetic diction had the artifice of the crinoline; it would
stand by itself. The Romantics in their return to nature had
necessarily to abolish it.</p>
<p>But when all is said in criticism the poetry of the earlier half
of the eighteenth century excels all other English poetry in two
respects. Two qualities belong to it by virtue of the metre in
which it is most of it written&mdash;rapidity and antithesis. Its
antithesis made it an incomparable vehicle for satire, its rapidity
for narrative. Outside its limits we have hardly any even passable
satirical verse; within them there are half-a-dozen works of the
highest excellence in this kind. And if we except Chaucer, there is
no one else in the whole range of English poetry who have the
narrative gift so completely as the classic poets. Bentleys will
always exist who will assure us with civility that Pope's
<cite>Homer</cite>, though "very pretty," bears little relation to
the Greek, and that Dryden's <cite>Vergil</cite>, though vigorous
and virile, is a poor representation of its original. The truth
remains that for a reader who knows no ancient languages either of
those translations will probably give a better idea of their
originals than any other rendering in English that we possess. The
foundation of their method has been vindicated in the best modern
translations from the Greek.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>The term "eighteenth century" in the vocabulary of the literary
historian is commonly as vaguely used as the term Elizabethan. It
borrows as much as forty years from the seventeenth and gives away
ten to the nineteenth. The whole of the work of Dryden, whom we
must count as the first of the "classic" school, was accomplished
before chronologically it had begun. As a man and as an author he
was very intimately related to his changing times; he adapted
himself to them with a versatility as remarkable as that of the
Vicar of Bray, and, it may be added, as simple-minded. He mourned
in verse the death of Cromwell and the death of his successor,
successively defended the theological positions of the Church of
England and the Church of Rome, changed his religion and became
Poet Laureate to James II., and acquiesced with perfect equanimity
in the Revolution which brought in his successor. This instability
of conviction, though it gave a handle to his opponents in
controversy, does not appear to have caused any serious scandal or
disgust among his contemporaries, and it has certainly had little
effect on the judgment of later times. It has raised none of the
reproaches which have been cast at the suspected apostasy of
Wordsworth. Dryden had little interest in political or religious
questions; his instinct, one must conceive, was to conform to the
prevailing mode and to trouble himself no further about the matter.
Defoe told the truth about him when he wrote that "Dryden might
have been told his fate that, having his extraordinary genius slung
and pitched upon a swivel, it would certainly turn round as fast as
the times, and instruct him how to write elegies to Oliver Cromwell
and King Charles the Second with all the coherence imaginable; how
to write <cite>Religio Laici</cite> and the <cite>Hind and the
Panther</cite> and yet be the same man, every day to change his
principle, change his religion, change his coat, change his master,
and yet never change his nature." He never changed his nature, he
was as free from cynicism as a barrister who represents
successively opposing parties in suits or politics; and when he
wrote polemics in prose or verse he lent his talents as a barrister
lends his for a fee. His one intellectual interest was in his art,
and it is in his comments on his art&mdash;the essays and prefaces
in the composition of which he amused the leisure left in the busy
life of a dramatist and a poet of officialdom&mdash;that his most
charming and delicate work is to be found. In a way they begin
modern English prose; earlier writing furnishes no equal to their
colloquial ease and the grace of their expression. And they contain
some of the most acute criticism in our language&mdash;"classical"
in its tone (<em>i.e.</em>, with a preference for conformity) but
with its respect for order and tradition always tempered by good
sense and wit, and informed and guided throughout by a taste whose
catholicity and sureness was unmatched in the England of his time.
The preface to his <cite>Fables</cite> contains some excellent
notes on Chaucer. They may be read as a sample of the breadth and
perspicuity of his critical perceptions.</p>
<p>His chief poetical works were most of them
occasional&mdash;designed either to celebrate some remarkable event
or to take a side and interpret a policy in the conflict, political
or religious, of the time. <cite>Absalom and Achitophel</cite> and
<cite>The Medal</cite> were levelled at the Shaftesbury-Monmouth
intrigues in the closing years of Charles II. <cite>Religio
Laici</cite> celebrated the excellence of the Church of England in
its character of <em>via media</em> between the opposite
extravagances of Papacy and Presbyterianism. <cite>The Hind and the
Panther</cite> found this perfection spotted. The Church of England
has become the Panther, whose coat is a varied pattern of heresy
and truth beside the spotless purity of the Hind, the Church of
Rome. <cite>Astrea Reddux</cite> welcomed the returning Charles;
<cite>Annus Mirabilis</cite> commemorated a year of fire and
victories, Besides these he wrote many dramas in verse, a number of
translations, and some shorter poems, of which the odes are the
most remarkable.</p>
<p>His qualities as a poet fitted very exactly the work he set
himself to do. His work is always plain and easily understood; he
had a fine faculty for narration, and the vigorous rapidity and
point of his style enabled him to sketch a character or sum up a
dialectical position very surely and effectively. His writing has a
kind of spare and masculine force about it. It is this vigour and
the impression which he gives of intellectual strength and of a
logical grasp of his subject, that beyond question has kept alive
work which, if ever poetry was, was ephemeral in its origin. The
careers of the unscrupulous Caroline peers would have been closed
for us were they not visible in the reflected light of his
denunciation of them. Though Buckingham is forgotten and
Shaftesbury's name swallowed up in that of his more philanthropic
descendant, we can read of Achitophel and Zimri still, and feel
something of the strength and heat which he caught from a fiercely
fought conflict and transmitted with his own gravity and
purposefulness into verse. The Thirty-nine Articles are not a
proper subject for poetry, but the sustained and serious allegory
which Dryden weaves round theological discussion preserves his
treatment of them from the fate of the controversialists who
opposed him. His work has wit and vitality enough to keep it
sweet.</p>
<p>Strength and wit enter in different proportions into the work of
his successor, Alexander Pope&mdash;a poet whom admirers in his own
age held to be the greatest in our language. No one would think of
making such a claim now, but the detraction which he suffered at
the hands of Wordsworth and the Romantics, ought not to make us
forget that Pope, though not our greatest, not even perhaps a
great, poet is incomparably our most brilliant versifier. Dryden's
strength turns in his work into something more fragile and
delicate, polished with infinite care like lacquer, and wrought
like filigree work to the last point of conscious and perfected
art. He was not a great thinker; the thoughts which he embodies in
his philosophical poems&mdash;the <cite>Essay on Man</cite> and the
rest, are almost ludicrously out of proportion to the solemnity of
the titles which introduce them, nor does he except very rarely get
beyond the conceptions common to the average man when he attempts
introspection or meditates on his own destiny. The reader in search
of philosophy will find little to stimulate him and in the facile
Deism of the time probably something to smile at. Pope has no
message to us now. But he will find views current in his time or
borrowed from other authors put with perfect felicity and wit, and
he will recognize the justice of Addison's comment that Pope's wit
and fine writing consist "not so much in advancing things that are
new, as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn." And he
will not fall into the error of dubbing the author a minor poet
because he is neither subtle nor imaginative nor profound. A great
poet would not have written like Pope&mdash;one must grant it; but
a minor poet could not.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of Pope's type of mind and kind of art that
there is no development visible in his work. Other poets,
Shakespeare, for instance, and Keats, have written work of the
highest quality when they were young, but they have had crudenesses
to shed&mdash;things to get rid of as their strength and
perceptions grew. But Pope, like Minerva, was full grown and full
armed from the beginning. If we did not know that his <cite>Essay
on Criticism</cite> was his first poem it would be impossible to
place it in the canon of his work; it might come in anywhere and so
might everything else that he wrote. From the beginning his
craftsmanship was perfect; from the beginning he took his
subject-matter from others as he found it and worked it up into
aphorism and epigram till each line shone like a cut jewel and the
essential commonplaceness and poverty of his material was obscured
by the glitter the craftsmanship lent to it. Subject apart,
however, he was quite sure of his medium from the beginning; it was
not long before he found the way to use it to most brilliant
purpose. <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite> and the satirical poems
come later in his career.</p>
<p>As a satirist Pope, though he did not hit so hard as Dryden,
struck more deftly and probed deeper. He wielded a rapier where the
other used a broadsword, and though both used their weapons with
the highest skill and the metaphor must not be imagined to impute
clumsiness to Dryden, the rapier made the cleaner cut. Both
employed a method in satire which their successors (a poor set) in
England have not been intelligent enough to use. They allow every
possible good point to the object of their attack. They appear to
deal him an even and regretful justice. His good points, they put
it in effect, being so many, how much blacker and more deplorable
his meannesses and faults! They do not do this out of charity;
there was very little of the milk of human kindness in Pope.
Deformity in his case, as in so many in truth and fiction, seemed
to bring envy, hatred, malice and all uncharitableness in its
train. The method is employed simply because it gives the maximum
satirical effect. That is why Pope's epistle to Arbuthnot, with its
characterisation of Addison, is the most damning piece of invective
in our language.</p>
<p><cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite> is an exquisite piece of
workmanship, breathing the very spirit of the time. You can fancy
it like some clock made by one of the Louis XIV. craftsmen,
encrusted with a heap of ormulu mock-heroics and impertinences and
set perfectly to the time of day. From no other poem could you
gather so fully and perfectly the temper of the society in which
our "classic" poetry was brought to perfection, its elegant
assiduity in trifles, its brilliant artifice, its paint and powder
and patches and high-heeled shoes, its measured strutting walk in
life as well as in verse. <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite> is a
mock-heroic poem; that is to say it applies the form and treatment
which the "classic" critics of the seventeenth century had laid
down as belonging to the "heroic" or "epic" style to a trifling
circumstance&mdash;the loss by a young lady of fashion of a lock of
hair. And it is the one instance in which this "recipe" for a
heroic poem which the French critics handed on to Dryden, and
Dryden left to his descendants, has been used well-enough to keep
the work done with it in memory. In a way it condemns the poetical
theory of the time; when forms are fixed, new writing is less
likely to be creative and more likely to exhaust itself in the
ingenious but trifling exercises of parody and burlesque. <cite>The
Rape of the Lock</cite> is brilliant but it is only play.</p>
<p>The accepted theory which assumed that the forms of poetry had
been settled in the past and existed to be applied, though it
concerned itself mainly with the ancient writers, included also two
moderns in its scope. You were orthodox if you wrote tragedy and
epic as Horace told you and satire as he had shown you; you were
also orthodox if you wrote in the styles of Spenser or Milton.
Spenser, though his predecessors were counted barbaric and his
followers tortured and obscure, never fell out of admiration;
indeed in every age of English poetry after him the greatest poet
in it is always to be found copying him or expressing their love
for him&mdash;Milton declaring to Dryden that Spenser was his
"original," Pope reading and praising him, Keats writing his
earliest work in close imitation. His characteristic style and
stanza were recognised by the classic school as a distinct "kind"
of poetry which might be used where the theme fitted instead of the
heroic manner, and Spenserian imitations abound. Sometimes they are
serious; sometimes, like Shenstone's <cite>Schoolmistress</cite>,
they are mocking and another illustration of the dangerous ease
with which a conscious and sustained effort to write in a fixed and
acquired style runs to seed in burlesque. Milton's fame never
passed through the period of obscurity that sometimes has been
imagined for him. He had the discerning admiration of Dryden and
others before his death. But to Addison belongs the credit of
introducing him to the writers of this time; his papers in the
<cite>Spectator</cite> on <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, with their
eulogy of its author's sublimity, spurred the interest of the poets
among his readers. From Milton the eighteenth century got the chief
and most ponderous part of its poetic diction, high-sounding
periphrases and borrowings from Latin used without the gravity and
sincerity and fullness of thought of the master who brought them
in. When they wrote blank verse, the classic poets wrote it in the
Milton manner.</p>
<p>The use of these two styles may be studied in the writings of
one man, James Thomson. For besides acquiring a kind of anonymous
immortality with patriots as the author of "Rule, Britannia,"
Thomson wrote two poems respectively in the Spenserian and the
Miltonic manner, the former <cite>The Castle of Indolence</cite>,
the latter <cite>The Seasons</cite>. The Spenserian manner is
caught very effectively, but the adoption of the style of
<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, with its allusiveness, circumlocution
and weight, removes any freshness the <cite>Seasons</cite> might
have had, had the circumstances in them been put down as they were
observed. As it is, hardly anything is directly named; birds are
always the "feathered tribe" and everything else has a similar
polite generality for its title. Thomson was a simple-minded man,
with a faculty for watching and enjoying nature which belonged to
few in his sophisticated age; it is unfortunate he should have
spent his working hours in rendering the fruit of country rambles
freshly observed into a cold and stilted diction. It suited the
eighteenth century reader well, for not understanding nature
herself he was naturally obliged to read her in translations.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>The chief merits of "classic" poetry&mdash;its clearness, its
vigour, its direct statement&mdash;are such as belong theoretically
rather to prose than to poetry. In fact, it was in prose that the
most vigorous intellect of the time found itself. We have seen how
Dryden, reversing the habit of other poets, succeeded in expressing
his personality not in poetry which was his vocation, but in prose
which was the amusement of his leisure hours. Spenser had put his
politics into prose and his ideals into verse; Dryden wrote his
politics&mdash;to order&mdash;in verse, and in prose set down the
thoughts and fancies which were the deepest part of him because
they were about his art. The metaphor of parentage, though honoured
by use, fits badly on to literary history; none the less the
tradition which describes him as the father of modern English prose
is very near the truth. He puts into practice for the first time
the ideals, described in the first chapter of this book, which were
set up by the scholars who let into English the light of the
Renaissance. With the exception of the dialogue on Dramatic Poesy,
his work is almost all of it occasional, the fruit of the mood of a
moment, and written rather in the form of a <em>causerie</em>, a
kind of informal talk, than of a considered essay. And it is all
couched in clear, flowing, rather loosely jointed English,
carefully avoiding rhetoric and eloquence and striving always to
reproduce the ease and flow of cultured conversation, rather than
the tighter, more closely knit style of consciously "literary"
prose. His methods were the methods of the four great prose-writers
who followed him&mdash;Defoe, Addison, Steele, and Swift.</p>
<p>Of these Defoe was the eldest and in some ways the most
remarkable. He has been called the earliest professional author in
our language, and if that is not strictly true, he is at any rate
the earliest literary journalist. His output of work was enormous;
he wrote on any and every subject; there was no event whether in
politics or letters or discovery but he was not ready with
something pat on it before the public interest faded. It followed
that at a time when imprisonment, mutilation, and the pillory took
the place of our modern libel actions he had an adventurous career.
In politics he followed the Whig cause and served the Government
with his pen, notably by his writings in support of the union with
Scotland, in which he won over the Scots by his description of the
commercial advantage which would follow the abolition of the
border. This line of argument, taken at a time when the governing
of political tendencies by commercial interests was by no means the
accepted commonplace it is now, proves him a man of an active and
original mind. His originality, indeed, sometimes over-reached the
comprehension both of the public and his superiors; he was
imprisoned for an attack on the Hanoverian succession, which was
intended ironically; apparently he was ignorant of what every
journalist ought to know that irony is at once the most dangerous
and the most ineffectual weapon in the whole armoury of the press.
The fertility and ingenuity of his intellect may be best gauged by
the number of modern enterprises and contrivances that are
foreshadowed in his work. Here are a few, all utterly unknown in
his own day, collected by a student of his works; a Board of Trade
register for seamen; factories for goods: agricultural credit
banks; a commission of enquiry into bankruptcy; and a system of
national poor relief. They show him to have been an independent and
courageous thinker where social questions were concerned.</p>
<p>He was nearly sixty before he had published his first novel,
<cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>, the book by which he is universally
known, and on which with the seven other novels which followed it
the foundation of his literary fame rests. But his earlier
works&mdash;they are reputed to number over two
hundred&mdash;possess no less remarkable literary qualities. It is
not too much to say that all the gifts which are habitually
recommended for cultivation by those who aspire to journalistic
success are to be found in his prose. He has in the first place the
gift of perfect lucidity no matter how complicated the subject he
is expounding; such a book as his <cite>Complete English
Tradesman</cite> is full of passages in which complex and difficult
subject-matter is set forth so plainly and clearly that the least
literate of his readers could have no doubt of his understanding
it. He has also an amazingly exact acquaintance with the
technicalities of all kinds of trades and professions; none of our
writers, not even Shakespeare, shows half such a knowledge of the
circumstances of life among different ranks and conditions of men;
none of them has realized with such fidelity how so many different
persons lived and moved. His gift of narrative and description is
masterly, as readers of his novels know (we shall have to come back
to it in discussing the growth of the English novel); several of
his works show him to have been endowed with a fine faculty of
psychological observation. Without the least consciousness of the
value of what he was writing, nor indeed with any deliberate
artistic intention, he made himself one of the masters of English
prose.</p>
<p>Defoe had been the champion of the Whigs; on the Tory side the
ablest pen was that of Jonathan Swift. His works proclaim him to
have had an intellect less wide in its range than that of his
antagonist but more vigorous and powerful. He wrote, too, more
carefully. In his youth he had been private secretary to Sir
William Temple, a writer now as good as forgotten because of the
triviality of his matter, but in his day esteemed because of the
easy urbanity and polish of his prose. From him Swift learned the
labour of the file, and he declared in later life that it was
"generally believed that this author has advanced our English
tongue to as great a perfection as it can well bear." In fact he
added to the ease and cadences he had learned from Temple qualities
of vigour and directness of his own which put his work far above
his master's. And he dealt with more important subject-matter than
the academic exercises on which Temple exercised his fastidious and
meticulous powers of revision.</p>
<p>In temperament he is opposed to all the writers of his time.
There is no doubt but there was some radical disorder in his
system; brain disease clouded his intellect in his old age, and his
last years were death in life; right through his life he was a
savagely irritable, sardonic, dark and violent man, impatient of
the slightest contradiction or thwarting, and given to explosive
and instantaneous rage. He delighted in flouting convention,
gloried in outraging decency. The rage, which, as he said himself,
tore his heart out, carried him to strange excesses. There is
something ironical (he would himself have appreciated it) in the
popularity of <cite>Gulliver's Travels</cite> as a children's
book&mdash;that ascending wave of savagery and satire which
overwhelms policy and learning to break against the ultimate
citadel of humanity itself. In none of his contemporaries (except
perhaps in the sentimentalities of Steele) can one detect the
traces of emotion; to read Swift is to be conscious of intense
feeling on almost every page. The surface of his style may be
smooth and equable but the central fires of passion are never far
beneath, and through cracks and fissures come intermittent bursts
of flame. Defoe's irony is so measured and studiously commonplace
that perhaps those who imprisoned him because they believed him to
be serious are hardly to be blamed; Swift's quivers and reddens
with anger in every line.</p>
<p>But his pen seldom slips from the strong grasp of his
controlling art. The extraordinary skill and closeness of his
allegorical writings&mdash;unmatched in their kind&mdash;is witness
to the care and sustained labour which went to their making. He is
content with no general correspondences; his allegory does not fade
away into a story in which only the main characters have a
secondary significance; the minutest circumstances have a bearing
in the satire and the moral. In <cite>The Tale of a Tub</cite> and
in <cite>Gulliver's Travels</cite>&mdash;particularly in the
former&mdash;the multitude as well as the aptness of the parallels
between the imaginary narrative and the facts it is meant to
represent is unrivalled in works of the kind. Only the highest
mental powers, working with intense fervour and concentration,
could have achieved the sustained brilliancy of the result. "What a
genius I had when I wrote that book!" Swift is said to have
exclaimed in his old age when he re-read <cite>The Tale of a
Tub</cite>, and certainly the book is a marvel of constructive
skill, all the more striking because it makes allegory out of
history and consequently is denied that freedom of narrative so
brilliantly employed in the <cite>Travels</cite>.</p>
<p>Informing all his writings too, besides intense feeling and an
omnipresent and controlling art, is strong common sense. His
aphorisms, both those collected under the heading of <cite>Thoughts
on Various Subjects</cite>, and countless others scattered up and
down his pages, are a treasury of sound, if a little sardonic,
practical wisdom. His most insistent prejudices foreshadow in their
essential sanity and justness those of that great master of life,
Dr. Johnson. He could not endure over-politeness, a vice which must
have been very oppressive in society of his day. He savagely
resented and condemned a display of affection&mdash;particularly
marital affection&mdash;in public. In an age when it was the normal
social system of settling quarrels, he condemned duelling; and he
said some very wise things&mdash;things that might still be
said&mdash;on modern education. In economics he was as
right-hearted as Ruskin and as wrong-headed. Carlyle, who was in so
many respects an echo of him, found in a passage in his works a
"dim anticipation" of his philosophy of clothes.</p>
<p>The leading literary invention of the period&mdash;after that of
the heroic couplet for verse&mdash;was the prose periodical essay.
Defoe, it is hardly necessary to say, began it; it was his nature
to be first with any new thing: but its establishment as a
prevailing literary mode is due to two authors, Joseph Addison and
Richard Steele. Of the two famous series&mdash;the
<cite>Tatler</cite> and the <cite>Spectator</cite>&mdash;for which
they were both responsible, Steele must take the first credit; he
began them, and though Addison came in and by the deftness and
lightness of his writing took the lion's share of their popularity,
both the plan and the characters round whom the bulk of the essays
in the <cite>Spectator</cite> came to revolve was the creation of
his collaborator. Steele we know very intimately from his own
writings and from Thackeray's portrait of him. He was an emotional,
full-blooded kind of man, reckless and dissipated but fundamentally
honest and good-hearted&mdash;a type very common in his day as the
novels show, but not otherwise to be found in the ranks of its
writers. What there is of pathos and sentiment, and most of what
there is of humour in the <cite>Tatler</cite> and the
<cite>Spectator</cite> are his. And he created the <em>dramatis
personae</em> out of whose adventures the slender thread of
continuity which binds the essays together is woven. Addison,
though less open to the onslaughts of the conventional moralist,
was a less lovable personality. Constitutionally endowed with
little vitality, he suffered mentally as well as bodily from
languor and lassitude. His lack of enthusiasm, his cold-blooded
formalism, caused comment even in an age which prided itself in
self-command and decorum.</p>
<p>His very malevolence proceeded from a flaccidity which meanly
envied the activities and enthusiasms of other men. As a writer he
was superficial; he had not the requisite energy for forming a
clear or profound judgment on any question of difficulty; Johnson's
comment, "He thinks justly but he thinks faintly" sums up the truth
about him. His good qualities were of a slighter kind than Swift's;
he was a quiet and accurate observer of manners and fashions in
life and conversation, and he had the gift of a style&mdash;what
Johnson calls "The Middle Style"&mdash;very exactly suited to the
kind of work on which he was habitually engaged, "always equable,
always easy, without glowing words or pointed sentences" but
polished, lucid, and urbane.</p>
<p>Steele and Addison were conscious moralists as well as literary
men. They desired to purge society from Restoration licences; to
their efforts we must credit the alteration in morality which
<cite>The School for Scandal</cite> shows over <cite>The Way of the
World</cite>. Their professed object as they stated themselves was
"to banish vice and ignorance out of the territories of Great
Britain, (nothing less!) and to bring philosophy out of closets and
libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies,
at tea-tables and coffee-houses." In fact their satires were
politically nearer home, and the chief objects of their aversion
were the Tory squires whom it was their business as Whigs to
deride. On the Coverley papers in the <cite>Spectator</cite> rests
the chief part of their literary fame; these belong rather to the
special history of the novel than to that of the periodical
essay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<br>
<h3>DR. JOHNSON AND HIS TIME</h3>
<p>By 1730 the authors whose work made the "classic" school in
England were dead or had ceased writing; by the same date Samuel
Johnson had begun his career as a man of letters. The difference
between the period of his maturity and the period we have been
examining is not perhaps easy to define; but it exists and it can
be felt unmistakably in reading. For one thing "Classicism" had
become completely naturalized; it had ceased to regard the French
as arbiters of elegance and literary taste; indeed Johnson himself
never spoke of them without disdain and hated them as much as he
hated Scotsmen. Writing, like dress and the common way of life,
became plainer and graver and thought stronger and deeper. In
manners and speech something of the brutalism which was at the root
of the English character at the time began to colour the refinement
of the preceding age. Dilettantism gave way to learning and
speculation; in the place of Bolingbroke came Adam Smith; in the
place of Addison, Johnson. In a way it is the solidest and sanest
time in English letters. Yet in the midst of its urbanity and order
forces were gathering for its destruction. The ballad-mongers were
busy; Blake was drawing and rhyming; Burns was giving songs and
lays to his country-side. In the distance&mdash;Johnson could not
hear them&mdash;sounded, like the horns of elf-land faintly
blowing, the trumpet calls of romance.</p>
<p>If the whole story of Dr. Johnson's life were the story of his
published books it would be very difficult to understand his
pre-eminent and symbolic position in literary history. His best
known work&mdash;it still remains so&mdash;was his dictionary, and
dictionaries, for all the licence they give and Johnson took for
the expression of a personality, are the business of purely
mechanical talents. A lesser man than he might have cheated us of
such delights as the definitions of "oats," or "net" or "pension,"
but his book would certainly have been no worse as a book. In his
early years he wrote two satires in verse in imitation of Juvenal;
they were followed later by two series of periodical essays on the
model of the <cite>Spectator</cite>; neither of them&mdash;the
<cite>Rambler</cite> nor the <cite>Idler</cite>&mdash;were at all
successful. <cite>Rasselas</cite>, a tale with a purpose, is
melancholy reading; the <cite>Journey to the Western
Hebrides</cite> has been utterly eclipsed by Boswell's livelier and
more human chronicle of the same events. The <cite>Lives of the
Poets</cite>, his greatest work, was composed with pain and
difficulty when he was seventy years old; even it is but a quarry
from which a reader may dig the ore of a sound critical judgment
summing up a life's reflection, out of the grit and dust of
perfunctory biographical compilations. There was hardly one of the
literary coterie over which he presided that was not doing better
and more lasting work. Nothing that Johnson wrote is to be
compared, for excellence in its own manner, with <cite>Tom
Jones</cite> or the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite> or the
<cite>Citizen of the World</cite>. He produced nothing in writing
approaching the magnitude of Gibbon's <cite>Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire</cite>, or the profundity of Burke's philosophy of
politics. Even Sir Joshua Reynolds, whose main business was
painting and not the pen, was almost as good an author as he; his
<cite>Discourses</cite> have little to fear when they are set
beside Johnson's essays. Yet all these men recognised him as their
guide and leader; the spontaneous selection of such a democratic
assembly as men of genius in a tavern fixed upon him as chairman,
and we in these later days, who are safe from the overpowering
force of personality and presence&mdash;or at least can only know
of it reflected in books&mdash;instinctively recognize him as the
greatest man of his age. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Johnson's pre-eminence is the pre-eminence of character. He was
a great moralist; he summed up in himself the tendencies of thought
and literature of his time and excelled all others in his grasp of
them; and he was perhaps more completely than any one else in the
whole history of English literature, the typical Englishman. He was
one of those to whom is applicable the commonplace that he was
greater than his books. It is the fashion nowadays among some
critics to speak of his biographer Boswell as if he were a novelist
or a playwright and to classify the Johnson we know with Hamlet and
Don Quixote as the product of creative or imaginative art, working
on a "lost original." No exercise of critical ingenuity could be
more futile or impertinent. The impression of the solidity and
magnitude of Johnson's character which is to be gathered from
Boswell is enforced from other sources; from his essays and his
prayers and meditations, from the half-dozen or so lives and
reminiscences which were published in the years following his death
(their very number establishing the reverence with which he was
regarded), from the homage of other men whose genius their books
leave indisputable. Indeed the Johnson we know from Boswell, though
it is the broadest and most masterly portrait in the whole range of
biography, gives less than the whole magnitude of the man. When
Boswell first met him at the age of twenty-two, Johnson was
fifty-four. His long period of poverty and struggle was past. His
<cite>Dictionary</cite> and all his works except the <cite>Lives of
the Poets</cite> were behind him; a pension from the Crown had
established him in security for his remaining years; his position
was universally acknowledged. So that though the portrait in the
<cite>Life</cite> is a full-length study of Johnson the
conversationalist and literary dictator, the proportion it
preserves is faulty and its study of the early years&mdash;the
years of poverty, of the <cite>Vanity of Human Wishes</cite> and
<cite>London</cite>, of <cite>Rasselas</cite>, which he wrote to
pay the expenses of his mother's funeral, is slight.</p>
<p>It was, however, out of the bitterness and struggle of these
early years that the strength and sincerity of character which
carried Johnson surely and tranquilly through the time of his
triumph were derived. From the beginning he made no compromise with
the world and no concession to fashion. The world had to take him
at his own valuation or not at all. He never deviated one hair's
breadth from the way he had chosen. Judged by the standards of
journalistic success, the <cite>Rambler</cite> could not well be
worse than he made it. Compared with the lightness and gaiety and
the mere lip-service to morality of Addison its edification is
ponderous. Both authors state the commonplaces of conduct, but
Addison achieves lightness in the doing of it, and his manner by
means of which platitudes are stated lightly and pointedly and with
an air of novelty, is the classic manner of journalism. Johnson
goes heavily and directly to the point, handling well worn moral
themes in general and dogmatic language without any attempt to
enliven them with an air of discovery or surprise. Yet they were,
in a sense, discoveries to him; not one of them but was deeply and
sincerely felt; not one but is not a direct and to us a
pathetically dispassionate statement of the reflection of thirty
years of grinding poverty and a soul's anguish. Viewed in the light
of his life, the <cite>Rambler</cite> is one of the most moving of
books. If its literary value is slight it is a document in
character.</p>
<p>So that when he came to his own, when gradually the public whom
he despised and neglected raised him into a pontifical position
matched by none before him in England and none since save Carlyle,
he was sure of himself; success did not spoil him. His judgment was
unwarped by flattery. The almost passionate tenderness and humanity
which lay beneath his gruffness was undimmed. His personality
triumphed in all the fullness and richness which had carried it in
integrity through his years of struggle. For over twenty years from
his chair in taverns in the Strand and Fleet Street he ruled
literary London, imposed his critical principles on the great body
of English letters, and by his talk and his friendships became the
embodiment of the literary temperament of his age.</p>
<p>His talk as it is set down by Boswell is his best monument. It
was the happiest possible fate that threw those two men together,
for Boswell besides being an admirer and reporter sedulously
chronicling all his master said and did, fortunately influenced
both the saying and the doing. Most of us have some one in whose
company we best shine, who puts our wits on their mettle and spurs
us to our greatest readiness and vivacity. There is no doubt that
Boswell, for all his assumed humility and for all Johnson's
affected disdain, was just such a companion for Johnson. Johnson
was at his best when Boswell was present, and Boswell not only drew
Johnson out on subjects in which his robust common sense and
readiness of judgment were fitted to shine but actually suggested
and conducted that tour in Scotland which gave Johnson an
opportunity for displaying himself at his best. The recorded talk
is extraordinarily varied and entertaining. It is a mistake to
conceive Johnson as a monster of bear-like rudeness, shouting down
opposition, hectoring his companions, and habitually a blustering
verbal bully. We are too easily hypnotized by Macaulay's flashy
caricature. He could be merciless in argument and often wrongheaded
and he was always acute, uncomfortably acute, in his perception of
a fallacy, and a little disconcerting in his unmasking of pretence.
But he could be gay and tender too and in his heart he was a
shrinking and sensitive man.</p>
<p>As a critic (his criticism is the only side of his literary work
that need be considered), Johnson must be allowed a high place. His
natural indolence in production had prevented him from exhausting
his faculties in the more exacting labours of creative work, and it
had left him time for omnivorous if desultory reading, the fruits
of which he stored in a wonderfully retentive memory against an
occasion for their use. To a very fully equipped mind he brought
the service of a robust and acute judgment. Moreover when he
applied his mind to a subject he had a faculty of intense, if
fitful concentration; he could seize with great force on the heart
of a matter; he had the power in a wonderfully short time of
extracting the kernel and leaving the husk. His judgments in
writing are like those recorded by Boswell from his conversation;
that is to say he does not, as a critic whose medium was normally
the pen rather than the tongue would tend to do, search for fine
shades of distinction, subdivide subtleties, or be careful to admit
<em>caveats</em> or exceptions; he passes, on the contrary, rapid
and forcible verdicts, not seldom in their assertions untenably
sweeping, and always decided and dogmatic. He never affects
diffidence or defers to the judgments of others. His power of
concentration, of seizing on essentials, has given us his best
critical work&mdash;nothing could be better, for instance, than his
characterisation of the poets whom he calls the metaphysical school
(Donne, Crashaw, and the rest) which is the most valuable part of
his life of Cowley. Even where he is most prejudiced&mdash;for
instance in his attack on Milton's <cite>Lycidas</cite>&mdash;there
is usually something to be said for his point of view. And after
this concentration, his excellence depends on his basic common
sense. His classicism is always tempered, like Dryden's, by a
humane and sensible dislike of pedantry; he sets no store by the
unities; in his preface to Shakespeare he allows more than a
"classic" could have been expected to admit, writing in it, in
truth, some of the manliest and wisest things in Shakespearean
literature. Of course, he had his failings&mdash;the greatest of
them what Lamb called imperfect sympathy. He could see no good in
republicans or agnostics, and none in Scotland or France. Not that
the phrase "imperfect sympathy," which expresses by implication the
romantic critic's point of view, would have appealed to him. When
Dr. Johnson did not like people the fault was in them, not in him;
a ruthless objectivity is part of the classic equipment. He failed,
too, because he could neither understand nor appreciate poetry
which concerned itself with the sensations that come from external
nature. Nature was to him a closed book, very likely for a purely
physical reason. He was short-sighted to the point of myopia, and a
landscape meant nothing to him; when he tried to describe one as he
did in the chapter on the "happy valley" in <cite>Rasselas</cite>
he failed. What he did not see he could not appreciate; perhaps it
is too much to ask of his self-contained and unbending intellect
that he should appreciate the report of it by other men.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>As we have seen, Johnson was not only great in himself, he was
great in his friends. Round him, meeting him as an equal, gathered
the greatest and most prolific writers of the time. There is no
better way to study the central and accepted men of letters of the
period than to take some full evening at the club from Boswell,
read a page or two, watch what the talkers said, and then trace
each back to his own works for a complete picture of his
personality. The lie of the literary landscape in this wonderful
time will become apparent to you as you read. You will find Johnson
enthroned, Boswell at his ear, round him men like Reynolds and
Burke, Richardson and Fielding and Goldsmith, Robertson and Gibbon,
and occasionally drawn to the circle minnows like Beattie and a
genius like Adam Smith. Gray, studious in his college at Cambridge,
is exercising his fastidious talent; Collins' sequestered,
carefully nurtured muse is silent; a host of minor poets are riding
Pope's poetic diction, and heroic couplet to death. Outside
scattered about is the van of Romance&mdash;Percy collecting his
ballads; Burns making songs and verses in Scotland; the "mad"
people, Smart and Chatterton, and above all Blake, obscurely
beginning the work that was to finish in Wordsworth and Coleridge
and Keats.</p>
<p>Of Johnson's set the most remarkable figure was Edmund
Burke&mdash;"the supreme writer," as De Quincey called him, "of his
century." His writings belong more to the history of politics than
to that of literature, and a close examination of them would be out
of place here. His political theory strikes a middle course which
offends&mdash;and in his own day offended&mdash;both parties in the
common strife of political thinking. He believed the best
government to consist in a patriotic aristocracy, ruling for the
good of the people. By birth an Irishman, he had the innate
practicality which commonly lies beneath the flash and colour of
Irish forcefulness and rhetoric. That, and his historical training,
which influenced him in the direction of conceiving every
institution as the culmination of an evolutionary development, sent
him directly counter to the newest and most enthusiastically urged
political philosophy of his day&mdash;the philosophy stated by
Rousseau, and put in action by the French Revolution. He disliked
and distrusted "metaphysical theories," when they left the field of
speculation for that of practice, had no patience with "natural
rights" (which as an Irishman he conceived as the product of
sentimentalism) and applied what would nowadays be called a
"pragmatic" test to political affairs. Practice was the touchstone;
a theory was useless unless you could prove that it had worked. It
followed that he was not a democrat, opposed parliamentary reform,
and held that the true remedy for corruption and venality was not
to increase the size of the electorate, but to reduce it so as to
obtain electors of greater weight and independence. For him a
member of Parliament was a representative and not a delegate, and
must act not on his elector's wishes but on his own judgment. These
opinions are little in fashion in our own day, but it is well to
remember that in Burke's case they were the outcome not of
prejudice but of thought, and that even democracy may admit they
present a case that must be met and answered.</p>
<p>Burke's reputation as a thinker has suffered somewhat unjustly
as a result of his refusal to square his tenets either with
democracy or with its opposite. It has been said that ideas were
only of use to him so far as they were of polemical service, that
the amazing fertility and acuteness of his mind worked only in a
not too scrupulous determination to overwhelm his antagonists in
the several arguments&mdash;on India, or America, on Ireland or on
France&mdash;which made up his political career. He was, said
Carlyle, "vehement rather than earnest; a resplendent far-sighted
rhetorician, rather than a deep and earnest thinker." The words as
they stand would be a good description of a certain type of
politician; they would fit, for instance, very well on Mr.
Gladstone; but they do Burke less than justice. He was an innovator
in modern political thought, and his application of the historical
method to the study of institutions is in its way a not less
epoch-making achievement than Bacon's application of the inductive
method to science. At a time when current political thought, led by
Rousseau, was drawing its theories from the abstract conception of
"natural rights" Burke was laying down that sounder and deeper
notion of politics which has governed thinking in that department
of knowledge since. Besides this, he had face to face with the
affairs of his own day, a far-sightedness and sagacity which kept
him right where other men went wrong. In a nation of the blind he
saw the truth about the American colonies; he predicted with
exactitude the culmination of the revolution in Napoleon. Mere
rhetorical vehemence cannot explain the earnestness with which in a
day of diplomatic cynicism he preached the doctrine of an
international morality as strict and as binding as the morality
which exists between man and man. Surest of all, we have the
testimony, uninfluenced by the magic of language, of the men he
met. You could not, said Dr. Johnson, shelter with him in a shed
for a few moments from the rain without saying, "This is an
extraordinary man."</p>
<p>His literary position depends chiefly on his amazing gift of
expression, on a command of language unapproached by any writer of
his time. His eloquence (in writing not in speaking; he is said to
have had a monotonous delivery) was no doubt at bottom a matter of
race, but to his Irish readiness and flash and colour he added the
strength of a full mind, fortified by a wonderful store of reading
which a retentive and exact memory enabled him to bring instantly
to bear on the subject in hand. No writer before him, except Defoe,
had such a wide knowledge of the technicalities of different men's
occupations, and of all sorts of the processes of daily business,
nor could enlighten an abstract matter with such a wealth of
luminous analogy. It is this characteristic of his style which has
led to the common comparison of his writing with Shakespeare's;
both seem to be preternaturally endowed with more information, to
have a wider sweep of interest than ordinary men. Both were not
only, as Matthew Arnold said of Burke, "saturated with ideas," but
saturated too in the details of the business and desire of ordinary
men's lives; nothing human was alien from them. Burke's language
is, therefore, always interesting and always appropriate to his
thought; it is also on occasion very beautiful. He had a wonderful
command of clear and ringing utterance and could appeal when he
liked very powerfully to the sensibilities of his readers.
Rhetoricians are seldom free from occasional extravagance, and
Burke fell under the common danger of his kind. He had his moments
of falsity, could heap coarse and outrageous abuse on Warren
Hastings, illustrate the horrors of the Revolution by casting a
dagger on the floor of the House of Commons, and nourish hatred
beyond the bounds of justice or measure. But these things do not
affect his position, nor take from the solid greatness of his
work.</p>
<p>Boswell we have seen; after Burke and Boswell, Goldsmith was the
most brilliant member of the Johnson circle. If part of Burke's
genius is referable to his nationality, Goldsmith's is wholly so.
The beginning and the end of him was Irish; every quality he
possessed as a man and as a writer belongs to his race. He had the
Irish carelessness, the Irish generosity, the Irish quick temper,
the Irish humour. This latter gift, displayed constantly in a
company which had little knowledge of the peculiar quality of Irish
wit and no faculty of sympathy or imagination, is at the bottom of
the constant depreciation of him on the part of Boswell and others
of his set. His mock self-importance they thought ill-breeding; his
humorous self-depreciation and keen sense of his own
ridiculousness, mere lack of dignity and folly. It is curious to
read Boswell and watch how often Goldsmith, without Boswell's
knowing it, got the best of the joke. In writing he had what we can
now recognise as peculiarly Irish gifts. All our modern writers of
light half-farcical comedy are Irish. Goldsmith's <cite>She Stoops
to Conquer</cite>, is only the first of a series which includes
<cite>The School for Scandal, The Importance of being
Earnest</cite>, and <cite>You Never can Tell</cite>. And his
essays&mdash;particularly those of the <cite>Citizen of the
World</cite> with its Chinese vision of England and English
life&mdash;are the first fruit of that Irish detachment, that
ability to see "normally" English habits and institutions and
foibles which in our own day has given us the prefaces of Mr. Shaw.
As a writer Goldsmith has a lightness and delicate ease which
belongs rather to the school of the earlier eighteenth century than
to his own day; the enthusiasm of Addison for French literature
which he retained gave him a more graceful model than the
"Johnsonian" school, to which he professed himself to belong, could
afford.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>The eighteenth century novel demands separate treatment, and of
the other prose authors the most eminent, Edward Gibbon, belongs to
historical rather than to literary studies. It is time to turn to
poetry.</p>
<p>There orthodox classicism still held sway; the manner and metre
of Pope or Thomson ruled the roost of singing fowl. In the main it
had done its work, and the bulk of fresh things conceived in it
were dull and imitative, even though occasionally, as in the poems
of Johnson himself and of Goldsmith, an author arose who was able
to infuse sincerity and emotion into a now moribund convention. The
classic manner&mdash;now more that of Thomson than of
Pope&mdash;persisted till it overlapped romanticism; Cowper and
Crabbe each owe a doubtful allegiance, leaning by their formal
metre and level monotony of thought to the one and by their realism
to the other. In the meantime its popularity and its assured
position were beginning to be assailed in the coteries by the work
of two new poets.</p>
<p>The output of Thomas Gray and William Collins is small; you
might almost read the complete poetical works of either in an
evening. But for all that they mark a period; they are the first
definite break with the classic convention which had been
triumphant for upwards of seventy years when their prime came. It
is a break, however, in style rather than in essentials, and a
reader who seeks in them the inspiriting freshness which came later
with Wordsworth and Coleridge will be disappointed. Their carefully
drawn still wine tastes insipidly after the "beaded bubbles winking
at the brim" of romance. They are fastidious and academic; they
lack the authentic fire; their poetry is "made" poetry like
Tennyson's and Matthew Arnold's. On their comparative merits a deal
of critical ink has been spilt, Arnold's characterisation of Gray
is well known&mdash;"he never spoke out." Sterility fell upon him
because he lived in an age of prose just as it fell upon Arnold
himself because he lived too much immersed in business and routine.
But in what he wrote he had the genuine poetic gift&mdash;the gift
of insight and feeling. Against this, Swinburne with characteristic
vehemence raised the standard of Collins, the latchet of whose shoe
Gray, as a lyric poet, was not worthy to unloose. "The muse gave
birth to Collins, she did but give suck to Gray." It is more to our
point to observe that neither, though their work abounds in
felicities and in touches of a genuine poetic sense, was fitted to
raise the standard of revolt. Revolution is for another and braver
kind of genius than theirs. Romanticism had to wait for Burns and
Blake.</p>
<p>In every country at any one time there are in all probability
not one but several literatures flourishing. The main stream
flowing through the publishers and booksellers, conned by critics
and coteries, recognized as the national literature, is commonly
only the largest of several channels of thought. There are besides
the national literature local literatures&mdash;books, that is, are
published which enjoy popularity and critical esteem in their own
county or parish and are utterly unknown outside; there may even be
(indeed, there are in several parts of the country) distinct local
schools of writing and dynasties of local authors. These localized
literatures rarely become known to the outside world; the national
literature takes little account of them, though their existence and
probably some special knowledge of one or other of them is within
the experience of most of us. But every now and again some one of
their authors transcends his local importance, gives evidence of a
genius which is not to be denied even by those who normally have
not the knowledge to appreciate the particular flavour of locality
which his writings impart, and becomes a national figure. While he
lives and works the national and his local stream turn and flow
together.</p>
<p>This was the case of Robert Burns. All his life long he was the
singer of a parish&mdash;the last of a long line of "forbears" who
had used the Scottish lowland vernacular to rhyme in about their
neighbours and their scandals, their loves and their church.
Himself at the confluence of the two streams, the national and the
local, he pays his tribute to two sets of originals, talks with
equal reverence of names known to us like Pope and Gray and
Shenstone and names unknown which belonged to local "bards," as he
would have called them, who wrote their poems for an Ayrshire
public. If he came upon England as an innovator it was simply
because he brought with him the highly individualized style of
Scottish local vernacular verse; to his own people he was no
innovator but a fulfilment; as his best critic[<a href=
"#note-5">5</a>] says he brought nothing to the literature he
became a part of but himself. His daring and splendid genius made
the local universal, raised out of rough and cynical satirizing a
style as rich and humorous and astringent as that of Rabelais, lent
inevitableness and pathos and romance to lyric and song. But he was
content to better the work of other men. He made hardly anything
new.</p>
<p>Stevenson in his essay on Burns remarks his readiness to use up
the work of others or take a large hint from it "as if he had some
difficulty in commencing." He omits to observe that the very same
trait applies to other great artists. There seem to be two orders
of creative writers. On the one hand are the innovators, the new
men like Blake, Wordsworth, Byron and Shelley, and later Browning.
These men owe little to their predecessors; they work on their own
devices and construct their medium afresh for themselves. Commonly
their fame and acceptance is slow, for they speak in an unfamiliar
tongue and they have to educate a generation to understand their
work. The other order of artists have to be shown the way. They
have little fertility in construction or invention. You have to say
to them "Here is something that you could do too; go and do it
better," or "Here is a story to work on, or a refrain of a song;
take it and give it your subtlety, your music." The villainy you
teach them they will use and it will go hard with them if they do
not better the invention; but they do not invent for themselves. To
this order of artists Burns like Shakespeare, and among the lesser
men Tennyson, belongs. In all his plays Shakespeare is known to
have invented only one plot; in many he is using not only the
structure but in many places the words devised by an older author;
his mode of treatment depends on the conventions common in his day,
on the tragedy of blood, and madness and revenge, on the comedy of
intrigue and disguises, on the romance with its strange happenings
and its reuniting of long parted friends. Burns goes the same way
to work; scarcely a page of his but shows traces of some original
in the Scottish vernacular school. The elegy, the verse epistle,
the satirical form of <cite>Holy Willie's Prayer</cite>, the song
and recitative of <cite>The Jolly Beggars</cite>, are all to be
found in his predecessors, in Fergusson, Ramsay, and the local
poets of the south-west of Scotland. In the songs often whole
verses, nearly always the refrains, are from older folk poetry.
What he did was to pour into these forms the incomparable richness
of a personality whose fire and brilliance and humour transcended
all locality and all tradition, a personality which strode like a
colossus over the formalism and correctness of his time. His use of
familiar forms explains, more than anything else, his immediate
fame. His countrymen were ready for him; they could hail him on the
instant (just as an Elizabethan audience could hail Shakespeare) as
something familiar and at the same time more splendid than anything
they knew. He spoke in a tongue they could understand.</p>
<p>It is impossible to judge Burns from his purely English verse;
though he did it as well as any of the minor followers of the
school of Pope he did it no better. Only the weakest side of his
character&mdash;his sentimentalism&mdash;finds expression in it; he
had not the sense of tradition nor the intimate knowledge necessary
to use English to the highest poetic effect; it was indeed a
foreign tongue to him. In the vernacular he wrote the language he
spoke, a language whose natural force and colour had become
enriched by three centuries of literary use, which was capable,
too, of effects of humour and realism impossible in any tongue
spoken out of reach of the soil. It held within it an unmatched
faculty for pathos, a capacity for expressing a lambent and kindly
humour, a power of pungency in satire and a descriptive vividness
that English could not give. How express in the language of Pope or
even of Wordsworth an effect like this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">"They reeled, they set, they cross'd, they

<p>It may be objected that in all this there is only one word, and
but two or three forms of words that are not English. But the
accent, the rhythm, the air of it are all Scots, and it was a Burns
thinking in his native tongue who wrote it, not the Burns of</p>
<div class="poem">"Anticipation forward points the view ";</div>
<br>
or<br>
<div class="poem">"Pleasures are like poppies spread,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You grasp the flower, the bloom
is shed."</span></div>
<br>
or any other of the exercises in the school of Thomson and
Pope.<br>
<br>
<p>It is easy to see that though Burns admired unaffectedly the
"classic" writers, his native realism and his melody made him a
potent agent in the cause of naturalism and romance. In his ideas,
even more than in his style, he belongs to the oncoming school. The
French Revolution, which broke upon Europe when he was at the
height of his career, found him already converted to its
principles. As a peasant, particularly a Scotch peasant, he
believed passionately in the native worth of man as man and gave
ringing expression to it in his verse. In his youth his
liberal-mindedness made him a Jacobite out of mere antagonism to
the existing r&eacute;gime; the Revolution only discovered for him
the more logical Republican creed. As the leader of a loose-living,
hard drinking set, such as was to be found in every parish, he was
a determined and free-spoken enemy of the kirk, whose tyranny he
several times encountered. In his writing he is as vehement an
anti-clerical as Shelley and much more practical. The political
side of romanticism, in fact, which in England had to wait for
Byron and Shelley, is already full-grown in his work. He
anticipates and gives complete expression to one half of the
Romantic movement.</p>
<p>What Burns did for the idea of liberty, Blake did for that and
every other idea current among Wordsworth and his successors. There
is nothing stranger in the history of English literature than the
miracle by which this poet and artist, working in obscurity,
utterly unknown to the literary world that existed outside him,
summed up in himself all the thoughts and tendencies which were the
fruit of anxious discussion and propaganda on the part of the
authors&mdash;Wordsworth, Coleridge, Lamb&mdash;who believed
themselves to be the discoverers of fresh truth unknown to their
generation. The contemporary and independent discovery by Wallace
and Darwin of the principle of natural selection furnishes,
perhaps, a rough parallel, but the fact serves to show how
impalpable and universal is the spread of ideas, how impossible it
is to settle literary indebtedness or construct literary genealogy
with any hope of accuracy. Blake, by himself, held and expressed
quite calmly that condemnation of the "classic" school that
Wordsworth and Coleridge proclaimed against the opposition of a
deriding world. As was his habit he compressed it into a rude
epigram,</p>
<div class="poem">"Great things are done when men and mountains
meet;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This is not done by jostling in
the street."</span></div>
<p>The case for nature against urbanity could not be more tersely
nor better put. The German metaphysical doctrine which was the
deepest part of the teaching of Wordsworth and Coleridge and their
main discovery, he expresses as curtly and off-handedly,</p>
<div class="poem">"The sun's light when he unfolds it,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Depends on the organ that beholds
it."</span></div>
<p>In the realm of childhood and innocence, which Wordsworth
entered fearfully and pathetically as an alien traveller, he moves
with the simple and assured ease of one native. He knows the
mystical wonder and horror that Coleridge set forth in <cite>The
Ancient Mariner</cite>. As for the beliefs of Shelley, they are
already fully developed in his poems. "The king and the priest are
types of the oppressor; humanity is crippled by "mind-forg'd
manacles"; love is enslaved to the moral law, which is broken by
the Saviour of mankind; and, even more subtly than by Shelley, life
is pictured by Blake as a deceit and a disguise veiling from us the
beams of the Eternal."[<a href="#note-6">6</a>]</p>
<p>In truth, Blake, despite the imputation of insanity which was
his contemporaries' and has later been his commentators' refuge
from assenting to his conclusions, is as bold a thinker in his own
way as Neitzsche and as consistent. An absolute unity of belief
inspires all his utterances, cryptic and plain. That he never
succeeded in founding a school nor gathering followers must be put
down in the first place to the form in which his work was issued
(it never reached the public of his own day) and the dark and
mysterious mythology in which the prophetic books which are the
full and extended statement of his philosophy, are couched, and in
the second place to the inherent difficulty of the philosophy
itself. As he himself says, where we read black, he reads white.
For the common distinction between good and evil, Blake substitutes
the distinction between imagination and reason; and reason, the
rationalizing, measuring, comparing faculty by which we come to
impute praise or blame is the only evil in his eyes. "There is
nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so;" to rid the
world of thinking, to substitute for reason, imagination, and for
thought, vision, was the object of all that he wrote or drew. The
implications of this philosophy carry far, and Blake was not afraid
to follow where they led him. Fortunately for those who hesitate to
embark on that dark and adventurous journey, his work contains
delightful and simpler things. He wrote lyrics of extraordinary
freshness and delicacy and spontaneity; he could speak in a child's
voice of innocent joys and sorrows and the simple elemental things.
His odes to "Spring" and "Autumn" are the harbingers of Keats. Not
since Shakespeare and Campion died could English show songs like
his</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"My silks and fine array."</div>
<br>
and the others which carry the Elizabethan accent. He could write
these things as well as the Elizabethans. In others he was
unique.<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Tiger! Tiger! burning bright<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the forests of the
night,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What immortal hand or
eye</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Could frame thy fearful

<br>
<h3>THE ROMANTIC REVIVAL</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>There are two ways of approaching the periods of change and new
birth in literature. The commonest and, for all the study which it
entails, the easiest, is that summed up in the phrase, literature
begets literature. Following it, you discover and weigh literary
influences, the influence of poet on poet, and book on book. You
find one man harking back to earlier models in his own tongue,
which an intervening age misunderstood or despised; another,
turning to the contemporary literatures of neighbouring countries;
another, perhaps, to the splendour and exoticism of the east. In
the matter of form and style, such a study carries you far. You can
trace types of poetry and metres back to curious and unsuspected
originals, find the well-known verse of Burns' epistles turning up
in Proven&ccedil;al; Tennyson's <cite>In Memoriam</cite> stanza in
use by Ben Jonson; the metre of <cite>Christabel</cite> in minor
Elizabethan poetry; the peculiar form of Fitzgerald's translation
of <cite>Omar Khayyam</cite> followed by so many imitators since,
itself to be the actual reflection of the rough metrical scheme of
his Persian original. But such a study, though it is profitable and
interesting, can never lead to the whole truth. As we saw in the
beginning of this book, in the matter of the Renaissance, every age
of discovery and re-birth has its double aspect. It is a revolution
in style and language, an age of literary experiment and
achievement, but its experiments are dictated by the excitement of
a new subject-matter, and that subject-matter is so much in the
air, so impalpable and universal that it eludes analysis. Only you
can be sure that it is this weltering contagion of new ideas, and
new thought&mdash;the "Zeitgeist," the spirit of the age, or
whatever you may call it&mdash;that is the essential and
controlling force. Literary loans and imports give the forms into
which it can be moulded, but without them it would still exist, and
they are only the means by which a spirit which is in life itself,
and which expresses itself in action, and in concrete human
achievement, gets itself into the written word. The romantic
revival numbers Napoleon amongst its leaders as well as Byron,
Wellington, Pitt and Wilberforce, as well as Keats and Wordsworth.
Only the literary manifestations of the time concern us here, but
it is important to remember that the passion for simplification and
for a return to nature as a refuge from the artificial complexities
of society, which inspired the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>,
inspired no less the course of the Revolution in France, and later,
the destruction by Napoleon of the smaller feudal states of
Germany, which made possible German nationality and a national
spirit.</p>
<p>In this romantic revival, however, the revolution in form and
style matters more than in most. The classicism of the previous age
had been so fixed and immutable; it had been enthroned in high
places, enjoyed the esteem of society, arrogated to itself the
acceptance which good breeding and good manners demanded. Dryden
had been a Court poet, careful to change his allegiance with the
changing monarchy. Pope had been the equal and intimate of the
great people of his day, and his followers, if they did not enjoy
the equality, enjoyed at any rate the patronage of many noble
lords. The effect of this was to give the prestige of social usage
to the verse in which they wrote and the language they used. "There
was," said Dr. Johnson, "before the time of Dryden no poetical
diction, no system of words at once refined from the grossness of
domestic use, and free from the harshness of terms appropriated to
particular arts. Words too familiar or too remote to defeat the
purpose of a poet." This poetic diction, refined from the grossness
of domestic use, was the standard poetic speech of the eighteenth
century. The heroic couplet in which it was cast was the standard
metre. So that the first object of the revolt of the romantics was
the purely literary object of getting rid of the vice of an unreal
and artificial manner of writing. They desired simplicity of
style.</p>
<p>When the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> of Wordsworth and
Coleridge were published in 1798, the preface which Wordsworth
wrote as their manifesto hardly touched at all on the poetic
imagination or the attitude of the poet to life and nature. The
only question is that of diction. "The majority of the following
poems," he writes, "are to be considered as experiments. They were
written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of
conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted
to the purposes of poetic pleasure." And in the longer preface to
the second edition, in which the theories of the new school on the
nature and methods of the poetic imagination are set forth at
length, he returns to the same point. "The language too, of these
men (that is those in humble and rustic life) has been adopted ...
because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from
which the best part of language is originally derived, and because
from their rank in society, and the sameness and narrow circle of
their intercourse, being less under the influence of social vanity,
they convey their feelings and notions in simple unelaborated
expressions." Social vanity&mdash;the armour which we wear to
conceal our deepest thoughts and feelings&mdash;that was what
Wordsworth wished to be rid of, and he chose the language of the
common people, not because it fitted, as an earlier school of poets
who used the common speech had asserted, the utterance of habitual
feeling and common sense, but because it is the most sincere
expression of the deepest and rarest passion. His object was the
object attained by Shakespeare in some of his supremest moments;
the bare intolerable force of the speeches after the murder of
Macbeth, or of King Lear's</p>
<div class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">"Do not laugh
at me,</span><br>
For as I am a man, I think this lady<br>
To be my child Cordelia."</div>
<p>Here, then, was one avenue of revolt from the tyranny of
artificiality, the getting back of common speech into poetry. But
there was another, earlier and more potent in its effect. The
eighteenth century, weary of its own good sense and sanity, turned
to the Middle Ages for picturesqueness and relief. Romance of
course, had not been dead in all these years, when Pope and Addison
made wit and good sense the fashionable temper for writing. There
was a strong romantic tradition in the eighteenth century, though
it does not give its character to the writing of the time. Dr.
Johnson was fond of old romances. When he was in Skye he amused
himself by thinking of his Scottish tour as the journey of a
knight-errant. "These fictions of the Gothic romances," he said,
"are not so remote from credibility as is commonly supposed." It is
a mistake to suppose that the passion for mediaevalism began with
either Coleridge or Scott. Horace Walpole was as enthusiastic as
either of them; good eighteenth century prelates like Hurd and
Percy, found in what they called the Gothic an inexhaustible source
of delight. As was natural, what attracted them in the Middle Ages
was not their resemblances to the time they lived in, but the
points in which the two differed. None of them had knowledge
enough, or insight enough, to conceive or sympathize with the
humanity of the thirteenth century, to shudder at its cruelties and
hardnesses and persecutions, or to comprehend the spiritual
elevation and insight of its rarest minds. "It was art," said
William Morris, "art in which all men shared, that made life
romantic as people called it in those days. That and not robber
barons, and inaccessible kings, with their hierarchy of serving
nobles, and other rubbish." Morris belonged to a time which knew
its middle ages better. To the eighteenth century the robber barons
and the "other rubbish" were the essence of romance. For Percy and
his followers, medievalism was a collection of what actors call
"properties" gargoyles, and odds and ends of armour and castle
keeps with secret passages, banners and gay colours, and gay
shimmering obsolete words. Mistaking what was on its surface at any
rate a subtle and complex civilization, for rudeness and
quaintness, they seemed to themselves to pass back into a freer
air, where any extravagance was possible, and good breeding and
mere circumspection and restraint vanished like the wind.</p>
<p>A similar longing to be rid of the precision and order of
everyday life drove them to the mountains, and to the literature of
Wales and the Highlands, to Celtic, or pseudo-Celtic romance. To
the fashion of the time mountains were still frowning and horrid
steeps; in Gray's Journal of his tour in the Lakes, a new
understanding and appreciation of nature is only struggling
through; and when mountains became fashionable, it was at first and
remained in part at least, till the time of Byron, for those very
theatrical qualities which had hitherto put them in abhorrence.
Wordsworth, in his <cite>Lines written above Tintern Abbey</cite>,
in which he sets forth the succeeding stages of his mental
development, refers to this love of the mountains for their
spectacular qualities, as the first step in the progress of his
mind to poetic maturity:</p>
<div class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">"The sounding
cataract</span><br>
Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock,<br>
The mountain and the deep and gloomy wood,<br>
Their colours and their forms were then to me<br>
An appetite."</div>
<p>This same passion for the "sounding cataract" and the "tall
rock," this appetite for the deep and gloomy wood, gave its vogue
in Wordsworth's boyhood to Macpherson's <cite>Ossian</cite>, a book
which whether it be completely fraudulent or not, was of capital
importance in the beginnings of the romantic movement.</p>
<p>The love of mediaeval quaintness and obsolete words, however,
led to a more important literary event&mdash;the publication of
Bishop Percy's edition of the ballads in the Percy folio&mdash;the
<cite>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</cite>. Percy to his own mind knew
the Middle Ages better than they knew themselves, and he took care
to dress to advantage the rudeness and plainness of his originals.
Perhaps we should not blame him. Sir Walter Scott did the same with
better tact and skill in his Border minstrelsy, and how many
distinguished editors are there, who have tamed and smoothed down
the natural wildness and irregularity of Blake? But it is more
important to observe that when Percy's reliques came to have their
influence on writing his additions were imitated as much as the
poems on which he grafted them. Chatterton's <cite>Rowley
Poems</cite>, which in many places seem almost inconceivably banal
and artificial to us to-day, caught their accent from the episcopal
editor as much as from the ballads themselves. None the less,
whatever its fault, Percy's collection gave its impetus to one half
of the romantic movement; it was eagerly read in Germany, and when
it came to influence Scott and Coleridge it did so not only
directly, but through Burger's imitation of it; it began the modern
study and love of the ballad which has given us <cite>Sister
Helen</cite>, the <cite>White Ship</cite> and the <cite>Lady of
Shalott</cite>.</p>
<p>But the romantic revival goes deeper than any change, however
momentous of fashion or style. It meant certain fundamental changes
in human outlook. In the first place, one notices in the authors of
the time an extraordinary development of imaginative sensibility;
the mind at its countless points of contact with the sensuous world
and the world of thought, seems to become more alive and alert. It
is more sensitive to fine impressions, to finely graded shades of
difference. Outward objects and philosophical ideas seem to
increase in their content and their meaning, and acquire a new
power to enrich the intensest life of the human spirit. Mountains
and lakes, the dignity of the peasant, the terror of the
supernatural, scenes of history, mediaeval architecture and armour,
and mediaeval thought and poetry, the arts and mythology of
Greece&mdash;all became springs of poetic inspiration and poetic
joy. The impressions of all these things were unfamiliar and
ministered to a sense of wonder, and by that very fact they were
classed as romantic, as modes of escape from a settled way of life.
But they were also in a sense familiar too. The mountains made
their appeal to a deep implanted feeling in man, to his native
sense of his own worth and dignity and splendour as a part of
nature, and his recognition of natural scenery as necessary, and in
its fullest meaning as sufficient for his spiritual needs. They
called him back from the artificiality and complexity of the cities
he had built for himself, and the society he had weaved round him,
to the natural world in which Providence had planted him of old,
and which was full of significance for his soul. The greatest poets
of the romantic revival strove to capture and convey the influence
of nature on the mind, and of the mind on nature interpenetrating
one another. They were none the less artists because they
approached nature in a state of passive receptivity. They believed
in the autocracy of the individual imagination none the less
because their mission was to divine nature and to understand her,
rather than to correct her profusions in the name of art.</p>
<p>In the second place the romantic revival meant a development of
the historical sense. Thinkers like Burke and Montesquieu helped
students of politics to acquire perspective; to conceive modern
institutions not as things separate, and separately created, but as
conditioned by, and evolved from, the institutions of an earlier
day. Even the revolutionary spirit of the time looked both before
and after, and took history as well as the human perfectibility
imagined by philosophers into its purview. In France the reformers
appealed in the first instance for a States General&mdash;a
mediaeval institution&mdash;as the corrective of their wrongs, and
later when they could not, like their neighbours in Belgium, demand
reform by way of the restoration of their historical rights, they
were driven to go a step further back still, beyond history to what
they conceived to be primitive society, and demand the rights of
man. This development of the historical sense, which had such a
widespread influence on politics, got itself into literature in the
creation of the historical novel. Scott and Chateaubriand revived
the old romance in which by a peculiar ingenuity of form, the
adventures of a typical hero of fiction are cast in a historical
setting and set about with portraits of real personages. The
historical sense affected, too, novels dealing with contemporary
life. Scott's best work, his novels of Scottish character, catch
more than half their excellence from the richness of colour and
proportion which the portraiture of the living people acquires when
it is aided by historical knowledge and imagination.</p>
<p>Lastly, besides this awakened historical sense, and this
quickening of imaginative sensibility to the message of nature, the
Romantic revival brought to literature a revival of the sense of
the connection between the visible world and another world which is
unseen. The supernatural which in all but the crudest of mechanisms
had been out of English literature since <cite>Macbeth</cite>, took
hold on the imaginations of authors, and brought with it a new
subtlety and a new and nameless horror and fascination. There is
nothing in earlier English literature to set beside the strange and
terrible indefiniteness of the <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, and
though much in this kind has been written since, we have not got
far beyond the skill and imagination with which Coleridge and Scott
worked on the instinctive fears that lie buried in the human
mind.</p>
<p>Of all these aspects of the revival, however, the new
sensitiveness and accessibility to the influences of external
nature was the most pervasive and the most important. Wordsworth
speaks for the love that is in homes where poor men lie, the daily
teaching that is in</p>
<div class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">"Woods and
rills;</span><br>
The silence that is in the starry sky,<br>
The peace that is among the lonely hills."</div>
<br>
Shelley for the wildness of the west wind, and the ubiquitous
spiritual emotion which speaks equally in the song of a skylark or
a political revolution. Byron for the swing and roar of the sea.
Keats for verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways. Scott and
Coleridge, though like Byron they are less with nature than with
romance, share the same communion.<br>
<br>
<p>This imaginative sensibility of the romantics not only deepened
their communion with nature, it brought them into a truer relation
with what had before been created in literature and art. The
romantic revival is the Golden Age of English criticism; all the
poets were critics of one sort or another&mdash;either formally in
essays and prefaces, or in passing and desultory flashes of
illumination in their correspondence. Wordsworth, in his prefaces,
in his letter to a friend of Burns which contains such a breadth
and clarity of wisdom on things that seem alien to his sympathies,
even in some of his poems; Coleridge, in his <cite>Biographia
Literaria</cite>, in his notes on Shakespeare, in those rhapsodies
at Highgate which were the basis for his recorded table talk; Keats
in his letters; Shelley in his <cite>Defence of Poetry</cite>;
Byron in his satires and journals; Scott in those lives of the
novelists which contain so much truth and insight into the works of
fellow craftsmen&mdash;they are all to be found turning the new
acuteness of impression which was in the air they breathed, to the
study of literature, as well as to the study of nature. Alongside
of them were two authors, Lamb and Hazlitt, whose bent was rather
critical than creative, and the best part of whose intelligence and
sympathy was spent on the sensitive and loving divination of our
earlier literature. With these two men began the criticism of
acting and of pictorial art that have developed since into two of
the main kinds of modern critical writing.</p>
<p>Romantic criticism, both in its end and its method, differs
widely from that of Dr. Johnson and his school. Wordsworth and
Coleridge were concerned with deep-seated qualities and
temperamental differences. Their critical work revolved round their
conception of the fancy and the imagination, the one dealing with
nature on the surface and decorating it with imagery, the other
penetrating to its deeper significances. Hazlitt and Lamb applied
their analogous conception of wit as a lower quality than humour,
in the same fashion. Dr. Johnson looked on the other hand for
correctness of form, for the subordination of the parts to the
whole, for the self-restraint and good sense which common manners
would demand in society, and wisdom in practical life. His school
cared more for large general outlines than for truth in detail.
They would not permit the idiosyncrasy of a personal or individual
point of view: hence they were incapable of understanding lyricism,
and they preferred those forms of writing which set themselves to
express the ideas and feelings that most men may be supposed to
have in common. Dr. Johnson thought a bombastic and rhetorical
passage in Congreve's <cite>Mourning Bride</cite> better than the
famous description of Dover cliff in <cite>King Lear</cite>. "The
crows, sir," he said of the latter, "impede your fall." Their town
breeding, and possibly, as we saw in the case of Dr. Johnson, an
actual physical disability, made them distrust any clear and
sympathetic rendering of the sense impressions which nature
creates. One cannot imagine Dr. Johnson caring much for the minute
observations of Tennyson's nature poems, or delighting in the
verdurous and mossy alleys of Keats. His test in such a case would
be simple; he would not have liked to have been in such places, nor
reluctantly compelled to go there would he in all likelihood have
had much to say about them beyond that they were damp. For the
poetry&mdash;such as Shelley's&mdash;which worked by means of
impalpable and indefinite suggestion, he would, one may conceive,
have cared even less. New modes of poetry asked of critics new
sympathies and a new way of approach. But it is time to turn to the
authors themselves.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>The case of Wordsworth is peculiar. In his own day he was
vilified and misunderstood; poets like Byron, whom most of us would
now regard simply as depending from the school he created, sneered
at him. Shelley and Keats failed to understand him or his motives;
he was suspected of apostasy, and when he became poet laureate he
was written off as a turn-coat who had played false to the ideals
of his youth. Now common opinion regards him as a poet above all
the others of his age, and amongst all the English poets standing
beside Milton, but a step below Shakespeare himself&mdash;and we
know more about him, more about the processes by which his soul
moved from doubts to certainties, from troubles to triumph, than we
do about any other author we have. This knowledge we have from the
poem called, <cite>The Prelude</cite>, which was published after
his death. It was designed to be only the opening and explanatory
section of a philosophical poem, which was never completed. Had it
been published earlier it would have saved Wordsworth from the
coldness and neglect he suffered at the hands of younger men like
Shelley; it might even have made their work different from what it
is. It has made Wordsworth very clear to us now.</p>
<p>Wordsworth is that rarest thing amongst poets, a complete
innovator. He looked at things in a new way. He found his subjects
in new places; and he put them into a new poetic form. At the
turning point of his life, in his early manhood, he made one great
discovery, had one great vision. By the light of that vision and to
communicate that discovery he wrote his greatest work. By and by
the vision faded, the world fell back into the light of common day,
his philosophy passed from discovery to acceptance, and all unknown
to him his pen fell into a common way of writing. The faculty of
reading which has added fuel to the fire of so many waning
inspirations was denied him. He was much too self-centred to lose
himself in the works of others. Only the shock of a change of
environment&mdash;a tour in Scotland, or abroad&mdash;shook him
into his old thrill of imagination, so that a few fine things
fitfully illumine the enormous and dreary bulk of his later work.
If we lost all but the <cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite>, the poems of
1804, and the <cite>Prelude</cite>, and the <cite>Excursion</cite>,
Wordsworth's position as a poet would be no lower than it is now,
and he would be more readily accepted by those who still find
themselves uncertain about him.</p>
<p>The determining factor in his career was the French
Revolution&mdash;that great movement which besides re-making France
and Europe, made our very modes of thinking anew. While an
undergraduate in Cambridge Wordsworth made several vacation visits
to France. The first peaceful phase of the Revolution was at its
height; France and the assembly were dominated by the little group
of revolutionary orators who took their name from the south-western
province from which most of them came, and with this
group&mdash;the Girondists&mdash;Wordsworth threw in his lot. Had
he remained he would probably have gone with them to the
guillotine. As it was, the commands of his guardian brought him
back to England, and he was forced to contemplate from a distance
the struggle in which he burned to take an active part. One is
accustomed to think of Wordsworth as a mild old man, but such a
picture if it is thrown back as a presentment of the Wordsworth of
the nineties is a far way from the truth. This darkly passionate
man tortured himself with his longings and his horror. War came and
the prayers for victory in churches found him in his heart praying
for defeat; then came the execution of the king; then the plot
which slew the Gironde. Before all this Wordsworth trembled as
Hamlet did when he learned the ghost's story. His faith in the
world was shaken. First his own country had taken up arms against
what he believed to be the cause of liberty. Then faction had
destroyed his friends whom he believed to be its standard bearers.
What was in the world, in religion, in morality that such things
could be? In the face of this tremendous problem, Wordsworth,
unlike Hamlet, was resolute and determined. It was, perhaps,
characteristic of him that in his desire to get his feet on firm
rock again he fled for a time to the exactest of sciences&mdash;to
mathematics. But though he got certainties there, they must have
been, one judges, certainties too arid for his thirsting mind. Then
he made his great discovery&mdash;helped to it, perhaps, by his
sister Dorothy and his friend Coleridge&mdash;he found nature, and
in nature, peace.</p>
<p>Not a very wonderful discovery, you will say, but though the
cleansing and healing force of natural surroundings on the mind is
a familiar enough idea in our own day, that is only because
Wordsworth found it. When he gave his message to the world it was a
new message. It is worth while remembering that it is still an
unaccepted one. Most of his critics still consider it only
Wordsworth's fun when he wrote:</p>
<div class="poem">"One impulse from the vernal wood<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Can teach us more of
man,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of moral evil and of
good,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Than all the sages
can."</span></div>
<br>
Yet Wordsworth really believed that moral lessons and ideas were to
be gathered from trees and stones. It was the main part of his
teaching. He claimed that his own morality had been so furnished
him, and he wrote his poetry to convince other people that what had
been true for him could be true for them too.<br>
<br>
<p>For him life was a series of impressions, and the poet's duty
was to recapture those impressions, to isolate them and brood over
them, till gradually as a result of his contemplation emotion
stirred again&mdash;an emotion akin to the authentic thrill that
had excited him when the impression was first born in experience.
Then poetry is made; this emotion "recollected" as Wordsworth said
(we may add, recreated) "in tranquillity" passes into enduring
verse. He treasured numberless experiences of this kind in his own
life. Some of them are set forth in the <cite>Prelude</cite>, that
for instance on which the poem <cite>The Thorn</cite> in the
<cite>Lyrical Ballads</cite> is based; they were one or other of
them the occasion of most of his poems; the best of them produced
his finest work&mdash;such a poem for instance as <cite>Resolution
and Independence</cite> or <cite>Gipsies</cite>, where some chance
sight met with in one of the poet's walks is brooded over till it
becomes charged with a tremendous significance for him and for all
the world. If we ask how he differentiated his experiences, which
had most value for him, we shall find something deficient. That is
to say, things which were unique and precious to him do not always
appear so to his readers. He counted as gold much that we regard as
dross. But though we may differ from his judgments, the test which
he applied to his recollected impressions is clear. He attached
most value to those which brought with them the sense of an
indwelling spirit, transfusing and interpenetrating all nature,
transfiguring with its radiance, rocks and fields and trees and the
men and women who lived close enough to them to partake of their
strength&mdash;the sense, as he calls it in his <cite>Lines above
Tintern Abbey</cite> of something "more deeply interfused" by which
all nature is made one. Sometimes, as in the hymn to Duty, it is
conceived as law. Duty before whom the flowers laugh, is the
daughter of the voice of God, through whom the most ancient heavens
are fresh and strong. But in most of his poems its ends do not
trouble; it is omnipresent; it penetrates everything and
transfigures everything; it is God. It was Wordsworth's belief that
the perception of this indwelling spirit weakened as age grew. For
a few precious and glorious years he had the vision</p>
<div class="poem">"When meadow, grove, and stream,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The earth, and every common
sight</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To me did seem</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Apparelled in celestial
light,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The glory and the freshness of a
dream."</span></div>
<br>
Then as childhood, when "these intimations of immortality," this
perception of the infinite are most strong, passed further and
further away, the vision faded and he was left gazing in the light
of common day. He had his memories and that was all.<br>
<br>
<p>There is, of course, more in the matter than this, and
Wordsworth's beliefs were inextricably entangled with the
conception which Coleridge borrowed from German philosophy.</p>
<div class="poem">"We receive but what we give"</div>
<br>
wrote Coleridge to his friend,<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"And in our life alone doth Nature live."</div>
<br>
And Wordsworth came to know that the light he had imagined to be
bestowed, was a light reflected from his own mind. It is easy to
pass from criticism to metaphysics where Coleridge leads, and wise
not to follow.<br>
<br>
<p>If Wordsworth represents that side of the Romantic Revival which
is best described as the return to Nature, Coleridge has
justification for the phrase "Renascence of Wonder." He revived the
supernatural as a literary force, emancipated it from the crude
mechanism which had been applied to it by dilettantes like Horace
Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe, and invested it instead with that air
of suggestion and indefiniteness which gives the highest potency to
it in its effect on the imagination. But Coleridge is more
noteworthy for what he suggested to others than for what he did in
himself. His poetry is, even more than Wordsworth's, unequal; he is
capable of large tracts of dreariness and flatness; he seldom
finished what he began. The <cite>Ancient Mariner</cite>, indeed,
which was the fruit of his close companionship with Wordsworth, is
the only completed thing of the highest quality in the whole of his
work. <cite>Christabel</cite> is a splendid fragment; for years the
first part lay uncompleted and when the odd accident of an
evening's intoxication led him to commence the second, the
inspiration had fled. For the second part, by giving to the fairy
atmosphere of the first a local habitation and a name, robbed it of
its most precious quality; what it gave in exchange was something
the public could get better from Scott. <cite>Kubla Khan</cite>
went unfinished because the call of a friend broke the thread of
the reverie in which it was composed. In the end came opium and
oceans of talk at Highgate and fouled the springs of poetry.
Coleridge never fulfilled the promise of his early days with
Wordsworth. "He never spoke out." But it is on the lines laid down
by his share in the pioneer work rather than on the lines of
Wordsworth's that the second generation of Romantic
poets&mdash;that of Shelley and Keats&mdash;developed.</p>
<p>The work of Wordsworth was conditioned by the French Revolution
but it hardly embodied the revolutionary spirit. What he conceived
to be its excesses revolted him, and though he sought and sang
freedom, he found it rather in the later revolt of the
nationalities against the Revolution as manifested in Napoleon
himself. The spirit of the revolution, as it was understood in
France and in Europe, had to wait for Shelley for its complete
expression. Freedom is the breath of his work&mdash;freedom not
only from the tyranny of earthly powers, but from the tyranny of
religion, expressing itself in republicanism, in atheism, and in
complete emancipation from the current moral code both in conduct
and in writing. The reaction which had followed the overthrow of
Napoleon at Waterloo, sent a wave of absolutism and repression all
over Europe, Italy returned under the heel of Austria; the Bourbons
were restored in France; in England came the days of Castlereagh
and Peterloo. The poetry of Shelley is the expression of what the
children of the revolution&mdash;men and women who were brought up
in and believed the revolutionary gospel&mdash;thought about these
things.</p>
<p>But it is more than that. Of no poet in English, nor perhaps in
any other tongue, could it be said with more surety, that the
pursuit of the spirit of beauty dominates all his work. For Shelley
it interfused all nature and to possess it was the goal of all
endeavour. The visible world and the world of thought mingle
themselves inextricably in his contemplation of it. For him there
is no boundary-line between the two, the one is as real and actual
as the other. In his hands that old trick of the poets, the simile,
takes on a new and surprising form. He does not enforce the
creations of his imagination by the analogy of natural appearances;
his instinct is just the opposite&mdash;to describe and illumine
nature by a reference to the creatures of thought. Other poets,
Keats for instance, or Tennyson, or the older poets like Dante and
Homer, might compare ghosts flying from an enchanter like leaves
flying before the wind. They might describe a poet wrapped up in
his dreams as being like a bird singing invisible in the brightness
of the sky. But Shelley can write of the west wind as</p>
<div class="poem">"Before whose unseen presence the leaves,
dead,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Are driven like ghosts from an
enchanter fleeing,"</span></div>
<br>
and he can describe a skylark in the heavens as<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Like a poet hidden<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the light of
thought."</span></div>
<p>Of all English poets he is the most completely lyrical. Nothing
that he wrote but is wrought out of the anguish or joy of his own
heart.</p>
<div class="poem">"Most wretched souls,"</div>
<br>
he writes<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Are cradled into poetry by wrong<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They learn in suffering what they
teach in song."</span></div>
<br>
Perhaps his work is too impalpable and moves in an air too
rarefied. It sometimes lacks strength. It fails to take grip enough
of life. Had he lived he might have given it these things; there
are signs in his last poems that he would have given it. But he
could hardly have bettered the sheer and triumphant lyricism of
<cite>The Skylark</cite>, of some of his choruses, and of the
<cite>Ode to Dejection</cite>, and of the <cite>Lines written on
the Eugenoen hills</cite>.<br>
<br>
<p>If the Romantic sense of the one-ness of nature found its
highest exponent in Shelley, the Romantic sensibility to outward
impressions reached its climax in Keats. For him life is a series
of sensations, felt with almost febrile acuteness. Records of sight
and touch and smell crowd every line of his work; the scenery of a
garden in Hampstead becomes like a landscape in the tropics, so
extraordinary vivid and detailed is his apprehension and enjoyment
of what it has to give him. The luxuriance of his sensations is
matched by the luxuriance of his powers of expression. Adjectives
heavily charged with messages for the senses, crowd every line of
his work, and in his earlier poems overlay so heavily the thought
they are meant to convey that all sense of sequence and structure
is apt to be smothered under their weight. Not that consecutive
thought claims a place in his conception of his poetry. His ideal
was passive contemplation rather than active mental exertion. "O
for a life of sensations rather than of thoughts," he exclaims in
one of his letters; and in another, "It is more noble to sit like
Jove than to fly like Mercury." His work has one message and one
only, the lastingness of beauty and its supreme truth. It is stated
in <cite>Endymion</cite> in lines that are worn bare with
quotation. It is stated again, at the height of his work in his
greatest ode,</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"Beauty is truth, truth beauty: that is all<br>
We know on earth and all we need to know."</div>
<br>
His work has its defects; he died at twenty-six so it would be a
miracle if it were not so. He lacks taste and measure; he offends
by an over-luxuriousness and sensuousness; he fails when he is
concerned with flesh and blood; he is apt, as Mr. Robert Bridges
has said, "to class women with roses and sweetmeats." But in his
short life he attained with surprising rapidity and completeness to
poetic maturity, and perhaps from no other poet could we find
things to match his greatest&mdash;<cite>Hyperion, Isabella</cite>,
the <cite>Eve of St. Agnes</cite> and the <cite>Odes</cite>.<br>
<br>
<p>There remains a poet over whom opinion is more sharply divided
than it is about any other writer in English. In his day Lord Byron
was the idol, not only of his countrymen, but of Europe. Of all the
poets of the time he was, if we except Scott, whose vogue he
eclipsed, the only one whose work was universally known and
popular. Everybody read him; he was admired not only by the
multitude and by his equals, but by at least one who was his
superior, the German poet Goethe, who did not hesitate to say of
him that he was the greatest talent of the century Though this
exalted opinion still persists on the Continent, hardly anyone
could be found in England to subscribe to it now. Without
insularity, we may claim to be better judges of authors in our own
tongue than foreign critics, however distinguished and
comprehending. How then shall be explained Lord Byron's instant
popularity and the position he won? What were the qualities which
gave him the power he enjoyed?</p>
<p>In the first place he appealed by virtue of his
subject-matter&mdash;the desultory wanderings of <cite>Childe
Harold</cite> traversed ground every mile of which was memorable to
men who had watched the struggle which had been going on in Europe
with scarcely a pause for twenty years. Descriptive journalism was
then and for nearly half a century afterwards unknown, and the poem
by its descriptiveness, by its appeal to the curiosity of its
readers, made the same kind of success that vividly written special
correspondence would to-day, the charm of metre super-added. Lord
Byron gave his readers something more, too, than mere description.
He added to it the charm of a personality, and when that
personality was enforced by a title, when it proclaimed its sorrows
as the age's sorrows, endowed itself with an air of symbolism and
set itself up as a kind of scapegoat for the nation's sins, its
triumph was complete. Most men have from time to time to resist the
temptation to pose to themselves; many do not even resist it. For
all those who chose to believe themselves blighted by pessimism,
and for all the others who would have loved to believe it, Byron
and his poetry came as an echo of themselves. Shallow called to
shallow. Men found in him, as their sons found more reputably in
Tennyson, a picture of what they conceived to be the state of their
own minds.</p>
<p>But he was not altogether a man of pretence. He really and
passionately loved freedom; no one can question his sincerity in
that. He could be a fine and scathing satirist; and though he was
careless, he had great poetic gifts.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>The age of the Romantic Revival was one of poetry rather than of
prose; it was in poetry that the best minds of the time found their
means of expression. But it produced prose of rare quality too, and
there is delightful reading in the works of its essayists and
occasional writers. In its form the periodical essay had changed
little since it was first made popular by Addison and Steele. It
remained, primarily, a vehicle for the expression of a personality,
and it continued to seek the interests of its readers by creating
or suggesting an individuality strong enough to carry off any
desultory adventure by the mere force of its own attractiveness.
Yet there is all the difference in the world between Hazlitt and
Addison, or Lamb and Steele. The <cite>Tatler</cite> and the
<cite>Spectator</cite> leave you with a sense of artifice; Hazlitt
and Lamb leave you with a grip of a real personality&mdash;in the
one case very vigorous and combative, in the other set about with a
rare plaintiveness and gentleness, but in both absolutely sincere.
Addison is gay and witty and delightful but he only plays at being
human; Lamb's essays&mdash;the translation into print of a heap of
idiosyncrasies and oddities, and likes and dislikes, and strange
humours&mdash;come straight and lovably from a human soul.</p>
<p>The prose writers of the romantic movement brought back two
things into writing which had been out of it since the seventeenth
century. They brought back egotism and they brought back
enthusiasm. They had the confidence that their own tastes and
experiences were enough to interest their readers; they mastered
the gift of putting themselves on paper. But there is one wide
difference between them and their predecessors. Robert Burton was
an egotist but he was an unconscious one; the same is, perhaps,
true though much less certainly of Sir Thomas Browne. In Lamb and
Hazlitt and De Quincey egotism was deliberate, consciously assumed,
the result of a compelling and shaping art. If one reads Lamb's
earlier essays and prose pieces one can see the process at
work&mdash;watch him consciously imitating Fuller, or Burton, or
Browne, mirroring their idiosyncrasies, making their quaintnesses
and graces his own. By the time he came to write the <cite>Essays
of Elia</cite>, he had mastered the personal style so completely
that his essays seem simply the overflow of talk. They are so
desultory; they move from one subject to another so
waywardly&mdash;such an essay as a <cite>Chapter on Ears</cite>,
for instance, passing with the easy inconsequence of conversation
from anatomy through organ music to beer&mdash;when they quote, as
they do constantly, it is incorrectly, as in the random
reminiscences of talk. Here one would say is the cream risen to the
surface of a full mind and skimmed at one taking. How far all this
is from the truth we know&mdash;know, too, how for months he
polished and rewrote these magazine articles, rubbing away
roughnesses and corners, taking off the traces of logical sequences
and argument, till in the finished work of art he mimicked
inconsequence so perfectly that his friends might have been
deceived. And the personality he put on paper was partly an
artistic creation, too. In life Lamb was a nervous, easily
excitable and emotional man; his years were worn with the memory of
a great tragedy and the constantly impending fear of a repetition
of it. One must assume him in his way to have been a good man of
business&mdash;he was a clerk in the India House, then a throbbing
centre of trade, and the largest commercial concern in England, and
when he retired his employers gave him a very handsome pension. In
the early portrait by Hazlitt there is a dark and gleaming look of
fire and decision. But you would never guess it from his books.
There he is the gentle recluse, dreaming over old books, old
furniture, old prints, old plays and play-bills; living always in
the past, loving in the town secluded byways like the Temple, or
the libraries of Oxford Colleges, and in the country quiet and
shaded lanes, none of the age's enthusiasm for mountains in his
soul. When he turned critic it was not to discern and praise the
power and beauty in the works of his contemporaries but to
rediscover and interpret the Elizabethan and Jacobean romantic
plays.</p>
<p>This quality of egotism Lamb shares with other writers of the
time, with De Quincey, for instance, who left buried in work which
is extensive and unequal, much that lives by virtue of the singular
elaborateness and loftiness of the style which he could on occasion
command. For the revival of enthusiasm one must turn to Hazlitt,
who brought his passionate and combative disposition to the service
of criticism, and produced a series of studies remarkable for their
earnestness and their vigour, and for the essential justness which
they display despite the prejudice on which each of them was
confessedly based.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<br>
<h3>THE VICTORIAN AGE</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>Had it not been that with two exceptions all the poets of the
Romantic Revival died early, it might be more difficult to draw a
line between their school and that of their successors than it is.
As it happened, the only poet who survived and wrote was
Wordsworth, the oldest of them all. For long before his death he
did nothing that had one touch of the fire and beauty of his
earlier work. The respect he began, after a lifetime of neglect, to
receive in the years immediately before his death, was paid not to
the conservative laureate of 1848, but to the revolutionary in art
and politics of fifty years before. He had lived on long after his
work was done</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That blamed the living
man."</span></div>
<br>
All the others, Keats, Shelley, Byron were dead before 1830, and
the problem which might have confronted us had they lived, of adult
work running counter to the tendencies and ideals of youth, does
not exist for us. Keats or Shelley might have lived as long as
Carlyle, with whom they were almost exactly contemporary; had they
done so, the age of the Romantic Revival and the Victorian age
would have been united in the lives of authors who were working in
both. We should conceive that is, the whole period as one, just as
we conceive of the Renaissance in England, from Surrey to Shirley,
as one. As it is, we have accustomed ourselves to a strongly marked
line of division. A man must be on either one side or the other;
Wordsworth, though he wrote on till 1850, is on the further side,
Carlyle, though he was born in the same year as Keats, on the
hither side. Still the accident of length of days must not blind us
to the fact that the Victorian period, though in many respects its
ideals and modes of thinking differed from those of the period
which preceded it, is essentially an extension of the Romantic
Revival and not a fresh start. The coherent inspiration of
romanticism disintegrated into separate lines of development, just
as in the seventeenth century the single inspiration of the
Renaissance broke into different schools. Along these separate
lines represented by such men as Browning, the Pre-Raphaelites,
Arnold, and Meredith, literature enriched and elaborated itself
into fresh forms. None the less, every author in each of these
lines of literary activity invites his readers to understand his
direct relations to the romantic movement. Rossetti touches it
through his original, Keats; Arnold through Goethe and Byron;
Browning first through Shelley and then in item after item of his
varied subject-matter.<br>
<br>
<p>In one direction the Victorian age achieved a salient and
momentous advance. The Romantic Revival had been interested in
nature, in the past, and in a lesser degree in art, but it had not
been interested in men and women. To Wordsworth the dalesmen of the
lakes were part of the scenery they moved in; he saw men as trees
walking, and when he writes about them as in such great poems as
<cite>Resolution and Independence</cite>, the
<cite>Brothers</cite>, or <cite>Michael</cite>, it is as natural
objects he treats them, invested with the lonely remoteness that
separates them from the complexities and passions of life as it is
lived. They are there, you feel, to teach the same lesson as the
landscape teaches in which they are set. The passing of the old
Cumberland beggar through villages and past farmsteads, brings to
those who see him the same kind of consolation as the impulses from
a vernal wood that Wordsworth celebrated in his purely nature
poetry. Compare with Wordsworth, Browning, and note the fundamental
change in the attitude of the poet that his work reveals.
<cite>Pippa Passes</cite> is a poem on exactly the same scheme as
the <cite>Old Cumberland Beggar</cite>, but in treatment no two
things could be further apart. The intervention of Pippa is
dramatic, and though her song is in the same key as the wordless
message of Wordsworth's beggar she is a world apart from him,
because she is something not out of natural history, but out of
life. The Victorian age extended the imaginative sensibility which
its predecessor had brought to bear on nature and history, to the
complexities of human life. It searched for individuality in
character, studied it with a loving minuteness, and built up out of
its discoveries amongst men and women a body of literature which in
its very mode of conception was more closely related to life, and
thus the object of greater interest and excitement to its readers,
than anything which had been written in the previous ages. It is
the direct result of this extension of romanticism that the novel
became the characteristic means of literary expression of the time,
and that Browning, the poet who more than all others represents the
essential spirit of his age, should have been as it were, a
novelist in verse. Only one other literary form, indeed, could have
ministered adequately to this awakened interest, but by some luck
not easy to understand, the drama, which might have done with
greater economy and directness the work the novel had to do,
remained outside the main stream of literary activity. To the drama
at last it would seem that we are returning, and it may be that in
the future the direct representation of the clash of human life
which is still mainly in the hands of our novelists, may come back
to its own domain.</p>
<p>The Victorian age then added humanity to nature and art as the
subject-matter of literature. But it went further than that. For
the first time since the Renaissance, came an era which was
conscious of itself as an epoch in the history of mankind, and
confident of its mission. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
revolutionized cosmography, and altered the face of the physical
world. The nineteenth century, by the discoveries of its men of
science, and by the remarkable and rapid succession of inventions
which revolutionized the outward face of life, made hardly less
alteration in accepted ways of thinking. The evolutionary theory,
which had been in the air since Goethe, and to which Darwin was
able to give an incontrovertible basis of scientific fact,
profoundly influenced man's attitude to nature and to religion.
Physical as apart from natural science made scarcely less advance,
and instead of a world created in some fixed moment of time, on
which had been placed by some outward agency all the forms and
shapes of nature that we know, came the conception of a planet
congealing out of a nebula, and of some lower, simpler and primeval
form of life multiplying and diversifying itself through succeeding
stages of development to form both the animal and the vegetable
world. This conception not only enormously excited and stimulated
thought, but it gave thinkers a strange sense of confidence and
certainty not possessed by the age before. Everything seemed plain
to them; they were heirs of all the ages. Their doubts were as
certain as their faith.</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"There lives more faith in honest doubt<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Believe me than in half the
creeds."</span></div>
<br>
said Tennyson; "honest doubt," hugged with all the certainty of a
revelation, is the creed of most of his philosophical poetry, and
what is more to the point was the creed of the masses that were
beginning to think for themselves, to whose awakening interest his
work so strongly appealed. There were no doubt, literary
side-currents. Disraeli survived to show that there were still
young men who thought Byronically. Rossetti and his school held
themselves proudly aloof from the rationalistic and scientific
tendencies of the time, and found in the Middle ages, better
understood than they had been either by Coleridge or Scott, a
refuge from a time of factories and fact. The Oxford movement
ministered to the same tendencies in religion and philosophy; but
it is the scientific spirit, and all that the scientific spirit
implied, its certain doubt, its care for minuteness, and truth of
observation, its growing interest in social processes, and the
conditions under which life is lived, that is the central fact in
Victorian literature.<br>
<br>
<p>Tennyson represents more fully than any other poet this
essential spirit of the age. If it be true, as has been often
asserted, that the spirit of an age is to be found best in the work
of lesser men, his complete identity with the thought of his time
is in itself evidence of his inferiority to his contemporary,
Browning. Comparison between the two men seem inevitable; they were
made by readers when <cite>In Memoriam</cite> and <cite>Men and
Women</cite> came hot from the press, and they have been made ever
since. There could, of course, scarcely be two men more dissimilar,
Tennyson elaborating and decorating the obvious; Browning delving
into the esoteric and the obscure, and bringing up strange and
unfamiliar finds; Tennyson in faultless verse registering current
newly accepted ways of thought; Browning in advance thinking afresh
for himself, occupied ceaselessly in the arduous labour of creating
an audience fit to judge him. The age justified the accuracy with
which Tennyson mirrored it, by accepting him and rejecting
Browning. It is this very accuracy that almost forces us at this
time to minimise and dispraise Tennyson's work. We have passed from
Victorian certainties, and so he is apt when he writes in the mood
of <cite>Locksley Hall</cite> and the rest, to appear to us a
little shallow, a little empty, and a little pretentious.</p>
<p>His earlier poetry, before he took upon himself the burden of
the age, is his best work, and it bears strongly marked upon it the
influence of Keats. Such a poem for instance as <cite>Oenone</cite>
shows an extraordinarily fine sense of language and melody, and the
capacity caught from Keats of conveying a rich and highly coloured
pictorial effect. No other poet, save Keats, has had a sense of
colour so highly developed as Tennyson's. From his boyhood he was
an exceedingly close and sympathetic observer of the outward forms
of nature, and he makes a splendid use of what his eyes had taught
him in these earlier poems. Later his interest in insects and birds
and flowers outran the legitimate opportunity he possessed of using
it in poetry. It was his habit, his son tells us, to keep notebooks
of things he had observed in his garden or in his walks, and to
work them up afterwards into similes for the <cite>Princess</cite>
and the <cite>Idylls of the King</cite>. Read in the books written
by admirers, in which they have been studied and collected (there
are several of them) these similes are pleasing enough; in the text
where they stand they are apt to have the air of impertinences,
beautiful and extravagant impertinences no doubt, but alien to
their setting. In one of the <cite>Idylls of the King</cite> the
fall of a drunken knight from his horse is compared to the fall of
a jutting edge of cliff and with it a lance-like fir-tree, which
Tennyson had observed near his home, and one cannot resist the
feeling that the comparison is a thought too great for the thing it
was meant to illustrate. So, too, in the <cite>Princess</cite> when
he describes a handwriting,</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"In such a hand as when a field of corn<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bows all its ears before the
roaring East."</span></div>
<br>
he is using up a sight noted in his walks and transmuted into
poetry on a trivial and frivolous occasion. You do not feel, in
fact, that the handwriting visualized spontaneously called up the
comparison; you are as good as certain that the simile existed
waiting for use before the handwriting was thought of.<br>
<br>
<p>The accuracy of his observation of nature, his love of birds and
larvae is matched by the carefulness with which he embodies, as
soon as ever they were made, the discoveries of natural and
physical science. Nowadays, possibly because these things have
become commonplace to us, we may find him a little school-boy-like
in his pride of knowledge. He knows that</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"This world was once a fluid haze of light,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till toward the centre set the
starry tides</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And eddied wild suns that
wheeling cast</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The planets."</span></div>
<br>
just as he knows what the catkins on the willows are like, or the
names of the butterflies: but he is capable, on occasion of
"dragging it in," as in<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"The nebulous star we call the sun,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If that hypothesis of theirs be
sound."</span></div>
<br>
from the mere pride in his familiarity with the last new thing. His
dealings with science, that is, no more than his dealings with
nature, have that inevitableness, that spontaneous appropriateness
that we feel we have a right to ask from great poetry.<br>
<br>
<p>Had Edgar Allan Poe wanted an example for his theory of the
impossibility of writing, in modern times, a long poem, he might
have found it in Tennyson. His strength is in his shorter pieces;
even where as in <cite>In Memoriam</cite> he has conceived and
written something at once extended and beautiful, the beauty lies
rather in the separate parts; the thing is more in the nature of a
sonnet sequence than a continuous poem. Of his other larger works,
the <cite>Princess</cite>, a scarcely happy blend between burlesque
in the manner of the <cite>Rape of the Lock</cite>, and a serious
apostleship of the liberation of women, is solely redeemed by these
lyrics. Tennyson's innate conservatism hardly squared with the
liberalising tendencies he caught from the more advanced thought of
his age, in writing it. Something of the same kind is true of
<cite>Maud</cite>, which is a novel told in dramatically varied
verse. The hero is morbid, his social satire peevish, and a story
which could have been completely redeemed by the ending (the death
of the hero), which artistic fitness demands, is of value for us
now through its three amazing songs, in which the lyric genius of
Tennyson reached its finest flower. It cannot be denied, either,
that he failed&mdash;though magnificently&mdash;in the <cite>Idylls
of the King</cite>. The odds were heavily against him in the choice
of a subject. Arthur is at once too legendary and too shadowy for
an epic hero, and nothing but the treatment that Milton gave to
Satan (i.e. flat substitution of the legendary person by a newly
created character) could fit him for the place. Even if Arthur had
been more promising than he is, Tennyson's sympathies were
fundamentally alien from the moral and religious atmosphere of
Arthurian romance. His robust Protestantism left no room for
mysticism; he could neither appreciate nor render the mystical
fervour and exultation which is in the old history of the Holy
Grail. Nor could he comprehend the morality of a society where
courage, sympathy for the oppressed, loyalty and courtesy were the
only essential virtues, and love took the way of freedom and the
heart rather than the way of law. In his heart Tennyson's attitude
to the ideals of chivalry and the old stories in which they are
embodied differed probably very little from that of Roger Ascham,
or of any other Protestant Englishman; when he endeavoured to make
an epic of them and to fasten to it an allegory in which Arthur
should typify the war of soul against sense, what happened was only
what might have been expected. The heroic enterprise failed, and
left us with a series of mid-Victorian novels in verse in which the
knights figure as heroes of the generic mid-Victorian type.</p>
<p>But if he failed in his larger poems, he had a genius little
short of perfect in his handling of shorter forms. The Arthurian
story which produced only middling moralizing in the
<cite>Idylls</cite>, gave us as well the supremely written Homeric
episode of the <cite>Morte d'Arthur</cite>, and the sharp and
defined beauty of <cite>Sir Galahad</cite> and the <cite>Lady of
Shallott</cite>. Tennyson had a touch of the pre-Raphaelite faculty
of minute painting in words, and the writing of these poems is as
clear and na&iuml;ve as in the best things of Rossetti. He had also
what neither Rossetti nor any of his contemporaries in verse,
except Browning, had, a fine gift of understanding humanity. The
peasants of his English idylls are conceived with as much breadth
of sympathy and richness of humour, as purely and as surely, as the
peasants of Chaucer or Burns. A note of passionate humanity is
indeed in all his work. It makes vivid and intense his scholarly
handling of Greek myth; always the unchanging human aspect of it
attracts him most, in Oenone's grief, in the indomitableness of
Ulysses, the weariness and disillusionment in Tithonus. It has been
the cause of the comfort he has brought to sorrow; none of his
generation takes such a human attitude to death. Shelley could
yearn for the infinite, Browning treat it as the last and greatest
adventure, Arnold meet it clear eyed and resigned. To Wordsworth it
is the mere return of man the transient to Nature the eternal.</p>

<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>While Tennyson, in his own special way and, so to speak, in
collaboration with the spirit of the age, was carrying on the work
of Romanticism on its normal lines, Browning was finding a new
style and a new subject matter. In his youth he had begun as an
imitator of Shelley, and <cite>Pauline</cite> and
<cite>Paracelsus</cite> remain to show what the influence of the
"sun-treader" was on his poetry. But as early as his second
publication, <cite>Bells and Pomegranates</cite>, he had begun to
speak for himself, and with <cite>Men and Women</cite>, a series of
poems of amazing variety and brilliance, he placed himself
unassailably in the first rank. Like Tennyson's, his genius
continued high and undimmed while life was left him. <cite>Men and
Women</cite> was followed by an extraordinary narrative poem,
<cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>, and it by several volumes of
scarcely less brilliance, the last of which appeared on the very
day of his death.</p>
<p>Of the two classes into which, as we saw when we were studying
Burns, creative artists can be divided, Browning belongs to that
one which makes everything new for itself, and has in consequence
to educate the readers by whom its work can alone be judged. He was
an innovator in nearly everything he did; he thought for himself;
he wrote for himself, and in his own way. And because he refused to
follow ordinary modes of writing, he was and is still widely
credited with being tortured and obscure.[<a href="#note-7">7</a>]
The charge of obscurity is unfortunate because it tends to shut off
from him a large class of readers for whom he has a sane and
special and splendid message.</p>
<p>His most important innovation in form was his device of the
dramatic lyric. What interested him in life was men and women, and
in them, not their actions, but the motives which governed their
actions. To lay bare fully the working of motive in a narrative
form with himself as narrator was obviously impossible; the strict
dramatic form, though he attained some success in it, does not seem
to have attracted him, probably because in it the ultimate stress
must be on the thing done rather than the thing thought; there
remained, therefore, of the ancient forms of poetry, the lyric. The
lyric had of course been used before to express emotions imagined
and not real to the poet himself; Browning was the first to project
it to express imagined emotions of men and women, whether typical
or individual, whom he himself had created. Alongside this
perversion of the lyric, he created a looser and freer form, the
dramatic monologue, in which most of his most famous poems,
<cite>Cleon, Sludge the Medium, Bishop Blougram's Apology</cite>,
etc., are cast. In the convention which Browning established in it,
all kinds of people are endowed with a miraculous articulation, a
new gift of tongues; they explain themselves, their motives, the
springs of those motives (for in Browning's view every thought and
act of a man's life is part of an interdependent whole), and their
author's peculiar and robust philosophy of life. Out of the
dramatic monologues he devised the scheme of <cite>The Ring and the
Book</cite>, a narrative poem in which the episodes, and not the
plot, are the basis of the structure, and the story of a trifling
and sordid crime is set forth as it appeared to the minds of the
chief actors in succession. To these new forms he added the
originality of an extraordinary realism in style. Few poets have
the power by a word, a phrase, a flash of observation in detail to
make you see the event as Browning makes you see it.</p>
<p>Many books have been written on the philosophy of Browning's
poetry. Stated briefly its message is that of an optimism which
depends on a recognition of the strenuousness of life. The base of
his creed, as of Carlyle's, is the gospel of labour; he believes in
the supreme moral worth of effort. Life is a "training school" for
a future existence, and our place in it depends on the courage and
strenuousness with which we have laboured here. Evil is in the
world only as an instrument in the process of development; by
conquering it we exercise our spiritual faculties the more. Only
torpor is the supreme sin, even as in <cite>The Statue and the
Bust</cite> where effort would have been to a criminal end.</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"The counter our lovers staked was lost<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As surely as if it were lawful
coin:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the sin I impute to each
frustrate ghost</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Was, the unlit lamp and the
ungirt loin,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Though the end in sight was a
crime, I say."</span></div>
<br>
All the other main ideas of his poetry fit with perfect consistency
on to his scheme. Love, the manifestation of a man's or a woman's
nature, is the highest and most intimate relationship possible, for
it is an opportunity&mdash;the highest opportunity&mdash;for
spiritual growth. It can reach this end though an actual and
earthly union is impossible.<br>
<br>
<div class="poem">"She has lost me, I have gained her;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her soul's mine and thus grown
perfect,</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I shall pass my life's
remainder.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Life will just hold out the
proving</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Both our powers, alone and
blended:</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And then come the next life
quickly!</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This world's use will have been
ended."</span></div>
<br>
It follows that the reward of effort is the promise of immortality,
and that for each man, just because his thoughts and motives taken
together count, and not one alone, there is infinite hope.<br>
<br>
<p>The contemporaries of Tennyson and Browning in poetry divide
themselves into three separate schools. Nearest to them in temper
is the school of Matthew Arnold and Clough; they have the same
quick sensitiveness to the intellectual tendencies of the age, but
their foothold in a time of shifting and dissolving creeds is a
stoical resignation very different from the buoyant optimism of
Browning, or Tennyson's mixture of science and doubt and faith.
Very remote from them on the other hand is the backward-gazing
mediaevalism of Rossetti and his circle, who revived (Rossetti from
Italian sources, Morris from Norman) a Middle age which neither
Scott nor Coleridge had more than partially and brokenly
understood. The last school, that to which Swinburne and Meredith
with all their differences unite in belonging, gave up Christianity
with scarcely so much as a regret,</p>
<br>
<div class="poem">"We have said to the dream that caress'd and the
dread that smote us,<br>
Good-night and good-bye."</div>
<br>
and turned with a new hope and exultation to the worship of our
immemorial mother the earth. In both of them, the note of
enthusiasm for political liberty which had been lost in Wordsworth
after 1815, and was too early extinguished with Shelley, was
revived by the Italian Revolution in splendour and fire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>As one gets nearer one's own time, a certain change comes
insensibly over one's literary studies. Literature comes more and
more to mean imaginative literature or writing about imaginative
literature. The mass of writing comes to be taken not as
literature, but as argument or information; we consider it purely
from the point of view of its subject matter. A comparison will
make this at once clear. When a man reads Bacon, he commonly
regards himself as engaged in the study of English literature; when
he reads Darwin he is occupied in the study of natural science. A
reader of Bacon's time would have looked on him as we look on
Darwin now.</p>
<p>The distinction is obviously illogical, but a writer on English
literature within brief limits is forced to bow to it if he wishes
his book to avoid the dreariness of a summary, and he can plead in
extenuation the increased literary output of the later age, and the
incompleteness with which time so far has done its work in sifting
the memorable from the forgettable, the ephemeral from what is
going to last. The main body of imaginative prose
literature&mdash;the novel&mdash;is treated of in the next chapter
and here no attempt will be made to deal with any but the
admittedly greatest names. Nothing can be said, for instance, of
that fluent journalist and biased historian Macaulay, nor of the
mellifluousness of Newman, nor of the vigour of Kingsley or
Maurice; nor of the writings, admirable in their literary qualities
of purity and terseness, of Darwin or Huxley; nor of the culture
and apostleship of Matthew Arnold. These authors, one and all,
interpose no barrier, so to speak, between their subject-matter and
their readers; you are not when you read them conscious of a
literary intention, but of some utilitarian one, and as an essay on
English literature is by no means a handbook to serious reading
they will be no more mentioned here.</p>
<p>In the case of one nineteenth century writer in prose, this
method of exclusion cannot apply. Both Carlyle and Ruskin were
professional men of letters; both in the voluminous compass of
their works touched on a large variety of subjects; both wrote
highly individual and peculiar styles; and both without being
either professional philosophers or professional preachers, were as
every good man of letters, whether he denies it or not, is and must
be, lay moralists and prophets. Of the two Ruskin is plain and
easily read, and he derives his message; Carlyle, his original, is
apt to be tortured and obscure. Inside the body of his work the
student of nineteenth century literature is probably in need of
some guidance; outside so far as prose is concerned he can fend for
himself.</p>
<p>As we saw, Carlyle was the oldest of the Victorians; he was over
forty when the Queen came to the throne. Already his years of
preparation in Scotland, town and country, were over, and he had
settled in that famous little house in Chelsea which for nearly
half a century to come was to be one of the central hearths of
literary London. More than that, he had already fully formed his
mode of thought and his peculiar style. <cite>Sartor
Resartus</cite> was written and published serially before the Queen
came to the throne; the <cite>French Revolution</cite> came in the
year of her accession at the very time that Carlyle's lectures were
making him a fashionable sensation; most of his miscellaneous
essays had already appeared in the reviews. But with the strict
Victorian era, as if to justify the usually arbitrary division of
literary history by dynastic periods, there came a new spirit into
his work. For the first time he applied his peculiar system of
ideas to contemporary politics. <cite>Chartism</cite> appeared in
1839; <cite>Past and Present</cite>, which does the same thing as
<cite>Chartism</cite> in an artistic form, three years later. They
were followed by one other book&mdash;<cite>Latter Day
Pamphlets</cite>&mdash;addressed particularly to contemporary
conditions, and by two remarkable and voluminous historical works.
Then came the death of his wife, and for the last fifteen years of
his life silence, broken only briefly and at rare intervals.</p>
<p>The reader who comes to Carlyle with preconceived notions based
on what he has heard of the subject-matter of his books is certain
to be surprised by what he finds. There are histories in the canon
of his works and pamphlets on contemporary problems, but they are
composed on a plan that no other historian and no other social
reformer would own. A reader will find in them no argument, next to
no reasoning, and little practical judgment. Carlyle was not a
great "thinker" in the strictest sense of that term. He was under
the control, not of his reason, but of his emotions; deep feeling,
a volcanic intensity of temperament flaming into the light and heat
of prophecy, invective, derision, or a simple splendour of
eloquence, is the characteristic of his work. Against cold-blooded
argument his passionate nature rose in fierce rebellion; he had no
patience with the formalist or the doctrinaire. Nor had he the
faculty of analysis; his historical works are a series of pictures
or tableaux, splendidly and vividly conceived, and with enormous
colour and a fine illusion of reality, but one-sided as regards the
truth. In his essays on hero-worship he contents himself with a
noisy reiteration of the general predicate of heroism; there is
very little except their names and the titles to differentiate one
sort of hero from another. His picture of contemporary conditions
is not so much a reasoned indictment as a wild and fantastic orgy
of epithets: "dark simmering pit of Tophet," "bottomless universal
hypocrisies," and all the rest. In it all he left no practical
scheme. His works are fundamentally not about politics or history
or literature, but about himself. They are the exposition of a
splendid egotism, fiercely enthusiastic about one or two deeply
held convictions; their strength does not lie in their matter of
fact.</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, a condemnation of him in the minds of those
people who ask of a social reformer an actuarially accurate scheme
for the abolition of poverty, or from a prophet a correct forecast
of the result of the next general election. Carlyle has little help
for these and no message save the disconcerting one of their own
futility. His message is at once larger and simpler, for though his
form was prose, his soul was a poet's soul, and what he has to say
is a poet's word. In a way, it is partly Wordsworth's own. The
chief end of life, his message is, is the performance of duty,
chiefly the duty of work. "Do thy little stroke of work; this is
Nature's voice, and the sum of all the commandments, to each man."
All true work is religion, all true work is worship; to labour is
to pray. And after work, obedience the best discipline, so he says
in <cite>Past and Present</cite>, for governing, and "our universal
duty and destiny; wherein whoso will not bend must break." Carlyle
asked of every man, action and obedience and to bow to duty; he
also required of him sincerity and veracity, the duty of being a
real and not a sham, a strenuous warfare against cant. The
historical facts with which he had to deal he grouped under these
embracing categories, and in the <cite>French Revolution</cite>,
which is as much a treasure-house of his philosophy as a history,
there is hardly a page on which they do not appear. "Quack-ridden,"
he says, "in that one word lies all misery whatsoever."</p>
<p>These bare elemental precepts he clothes in a garment of amazing
and bizarre richness. There is nothing else in English faintly
resembling the astonishing eccentricity and individuality of his
style. Gifted with an extraordinarily excitable and vivid
imagination; seeing things with sudden and tremendous vividness, as
in a searchlight or a lightning flash, he contrived to convey to
his readers his impressions full charged with the original emotion
that produced them, and thus with the highest poetic effect. There
is nothing in all descriptive writing to match the vividness of
some of the scenes in the <cite>French Revolution</cite> or in the
narrative part of <cite>Cromwell's Letters and Speeches</cite>, or
more than perhaps in any of his books, because in it he was setting
down deep-seated impressions of his boyhood rather than those got
from brooding over documents, in <cite>Sartor Resartus</cite>.
Alongside this unmatched pictorial vividness and a quite amazing
richness and rhythm of language, more surprising and original than
anything out of Shakespeare, there are of course, striking
defects&mdash;a wearisome reiteration of emphasis, a clumsiness of
construction, a saddening fondness for solecisms and hybrid
inventions of his own. The reader who is interested in these (and
every one who reads him is forced to become so) will find them
faithfully dealt with in John Sterling's remarkable letter (quoted
in Carlyle's <cite>Life of Sterling</cite>) on <cite>Sartor
Resartus</cite>. But gross as they are, and frequently as they
provide matter for serious offence, these eccentricities of
language link themselves up in a strange indissoluble way with
Carlyle's individuality and his power as an artist. They are not to
be imitated, but he would be much less than he is without them, and
they act by their very strength and pungency as a preservative of
his work. That of all the political pamphlets which the new era of
reform occasioned, his, which were the least in sympathy with it
and are the furthest off the main stream of our political thinking
now, alone continue to be read, must be laid down not only to the
prophetic fervour and fire of their inspiration but to the dark and
violent magic of their style.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<br>
<h3>THE NOVEL</h3>
<h4>(1)</h4>
<p>The faculty for telling stories is the oldest artistic faculty
in the world, and the deepest implanted in the heart of man. Before
the rudest cave-pictures were scratched on the stone, the
story-teller, it is not unreasonable to suppose, was plying his
trade. All early poetry is simply story-telling in verse. Stories
are the first literary interest of the awakening mind of a child.
As that is so, it is strange that the novel, which of all literary
ways of story-telling seems closest to the unstudied tale-spinning
of talk, should be the late discovery that it is. Of all the main
forms into which the literary impulse moulds the stuff of
imagination, the novel is the last to be devised. The drama dates
from prehistoric times, so does the epic, the ballad and the lyric.
The novel, as we know it, dates practically speaking from 1740.
What is the reason it is so late in appearing?</p>
<p>The answer is simply that there seems no room for good drama and
good fiction at the same time in literature; drama and novels
cannot exist side by side, and the novel had to wait for the
decadence of the drama before it could appear and triumph. If one
were to make a table of succession for the various kinds of
literature as they have been used naturally and spontaneously (not
academically), the order would be the epic, the drama, the novel;
and it would be obvious at once that the order stood for something
more than chronological succession, and that literature in its
function as a representation and criticism of life passed from form
to form in the search of greater freedom, greater subtlety, and
greater power. At present we seem to be at the climax of the third
stage in this development; there are signs that the fourth is on
the way, and that it will be a return to drama, not to the old,
formal, ordered kind, but, something new and freer, ready to gather
up and interpret what there is of newness and freedom in the spirit
of man and the society in which he lives.</p>
<p>The novel, then, had to wait for the drama's decline, but there
was literary story-telling long before that. There were mediaeval
romances in prose and verse; Renaissance pastoral tales, and
stories of adventure; collections, plenty of them, of short stories
like Boccaccio's, and those in Painter's <cite>Palace of
Pleasure</cite>. But none of these, not even romances which deal in
moral and sententious advice like <cite>Euphues</cite>, approach
the essence of the novel as we know it. They are all (except
<cite>Euphues</cite>, which is simply a framework of travel for a
book of aphorisms) simple and objective; they set forth incidents
or series of incidents; long or short they are anecdotes
only&mdash;they take no account of character. It was impossible we
should have the novel as distinct from the tale, till stories
acquired a subjective interest for us; till we began to think about
character and to look at actions not only outwardly, but within at
their springs.</p>
<p>As has been stated early in this book, it was in the seventeenth
century that this interest in character was first wakened.
Shakespeare had brought to the drama, which before him was
concerned with actions viewed outwardly, a psychological interest;
he had taught that "character is destiny," and that men's actions
and fates spring not from outward agencies, but from within in
their own souls. The age began to take a deep and curious interest
in men's lives; biography was written for the first time and
autobiography; it is the great period of memoir-writing both in
England and France; authors like Robert Burton came, whose delight
it was to dig down into human nature in search for oddities and
individualities of disposition; humanity as the great subject of
enquiry for all men, came to its own. All this has a direct bearing
on the birth of the novel. One transient form of literature in the
seventeenth century&mdash;the Character&mdash;is an ancestor in the
direct line. The collections of them&mdash;Earle's
<cite>Microcosmography</cite> is the best&mdash;are not very
exciting reading, and they never perhaps quite succeeded in
naturalizing a form borrowed from the later age of Greece, but
their importance in the history of the novel to come is clear. Take
them and add them to the story of adventure&mdash;<em>i.e.</em>,
introduce each fresh person in your plot with a description in the
character form, and the step you have made towards the novel is
enormous; you have given to plot which was already there, the added
interest of character.</p>
<p>That, however, was not quite how the thing worked in actual
fact. At the heels of the "Character" came the periodical essay of
Addison and Steele. Their interest in contemporary types was of the
same quality as Earle's or Hall's, but they went a different way to
work. Where these compressed and cultivated a style which was
staccato and epigrammatic, huddling all the traits of their subject
in short sharp sentences that follow each other with all the
brevity and curtness of items in a prescription, Addison and Steele
observed a more artistic plan. They made, as it were, the
prescription up, adding one ingredient after another slowly as the
mixture dissolved. You are introduced to Sir Roger de Coverley, and
to a number of other typical people, and then in a series of essays
which if they were disengaged from their setting would be to all
intents a novel and a fine one, you are made aware one by one of
different traits in his character and those of his friends, each
trait generally enshrined in an incident which illustrates it; you
get to know them, that is, gradually, as you would in real life,
and not all in a breath, in a series of compressed statements, as
is the way of the character writers. With the Coverley essays in
the <cite>Spectator</cite>, the novel in one of its
forms&mdash;that in which an invisible and all knowing narrator
tells a story in which some one else whose character he lays bare
for us is the hero&mdash;is as good as achieved.</p>
<p>Another manner of fiction&mdash;the autobiographical&mdash;had
already been invented. It grew directly out of the public interest
in autobiography, and particularly in the tales of their voyages
which the discoverers wrote and published on their return from
their adventures. Its establishment in literature was the work of
two authors, Bunyan and Defoe. The books of Bunyan, whether they
are told in the first person or no, are and were meant to be
autobiographical; their interest is a subjective interest. Here is
a man who endeavours to interest you, not in the character of some
other person he has imagined or observed, but in himself. His
treatment of it is characteristic of the awakening talent for
fiction of his time. <cite>The Pilgrim's Progress</cite> is begun
as an allegory, and so continues for a little space till the story
takes hold of the author. When it does, whether he knew it or not,
allegory goes to the winds. But the autobiographical form of
fiction in its highest art is the creation of Defoe. He told
stories of adventure, incidents modelled on real life as many
tellers of tales had done before him, but to the form as he found
it he super-added a psychological interest&mdash;the interest of
the character of the narrator. He contrived to observe in his
writing a scrupulous and realistic fidelity and appropriateness to
the conditions in which the story was to be told. We learn about
Crusoe's island, for instance, gradually just as Crusoe learns of
it himself, though the author is careful by taking his narrator up
to a high point of vantage the day after his arrival, that we shall
learn the essentials of it, as long as verisimilitude is not
sacrificed, as soon as possible. It is the paradox of the English
novel that these our earliest efforts in fiction were meant, unlike
the romances which preceded them, to pass for truth. Defoe's
<cite>Journal of the Plague Year</cite> was widely taken as literal
fact, and it is still quoted as such occasionally by rash though
reputable historians. So that in England the novel began with
realism as it has culminated, and across two centuries Defoe and
the "naturalists" join hands. Defoe, it is proper also in this
place to notice, fixed the peculiar form of the historical novel.
In his <cite>Memoirs of a Cavalier</cite>, the narrative of an
imaginary person's adventures in a historical setting is
interspersed with the entrance of actual historical personages,
exactly the method of historical romancing which was brought to
perfection by Sir Walter Scott.</p>
<br>
<h4>(2)</h4>
<p>In the eighteenth century came the decline of the drama for
which the novel had been waiting. By 1660 the romantic drama of
Elizabeth's time was dead; the comedy of the Restoration which
followed, witty and brilliant though it was, reflected a society
too licentious and artificial to secure it permanence; by the time
of Addison play-writing had fallen to journey-work, and the theatre
to openly expressed contempt. When Richardson and Fielding
published their novels there was nothing to compete with fiction in
the popular taste. It would seem as though the novel had been
waiting for this favourable circumstance. In a sudden burst of
prolific inventiveness, which can be paralleled in all letters only
by the period of Marlowe and Shakespeare, masterpiece after
masterpiece poured from the press. Within two generations, besides
Richardson and Fielding came Sterne and Goldsmith and Smollett and
Fanny Burney in naturalism, and Horace Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe
in the new way of romance. Novels by minor authors were published
in thousands as well. The novel, in fact, besides being the
occasion of literature of the highest class, attracted by its
lucrativeness that under-current of journey-work authorship which
had hitherto busied itself in poetry or plays. Fiction has been its
chief occupation ever since.</p>
<p>Anything like a detailed criticism or even a bare narrative of
this voluminous literature is plainly impossible without the limits
of a single chapter. Readers must go for it to books on the
subject. It is possible here merely to draw attention to those
authors to whom the English novel as a more or less fixed form is
indebted for its peculiar characteristics. Foremost amongst these
are Richardson and Fielding; after them there is Walter Scott.
After him, in the nineteenth century, Dickens and Meredith and Mr.
Hardy; last of all the French realists and the new school of
romance. To one or other of these originals all the great authors
in the long list of English novelists owe their method and their
choice of subject-matter.</p>
<p>With Defoe fiction gained verisimilitude, it ceased to deal with
the incredible; it aimed at exhibiting, though in strange and
memorable circumstances, the workings of the ordinary mind. It is
Richardson's main claim to fame that he contrived a form of novel
which exhibited an ordinary mind working in normal circumstances,
and that he did this with a minuteness which till then had never
been thought of and has not since been surpassed. His talent is
very exactly a microscopical talent; under it the common stuff of
life separated from its surroundings and magnified beyond previous
knowledge, yields strange and new and deeply interesting sights. He
carried into the study of character which had begun in Addison with
an eye to externals and eccentricities, a minute faculty of
inspection which watched and recorded unconscious mental and
emotional processes.</p>
<p>To do this he employed a method which was, in effect, a
compromise between that of the autobiography, and that of the tale
told by an invisible narrator. The weakness of the autobiography is
that it can write only of events within the knowledge of the
supposed speaker, and that consequently the presentation of all but
one of the characters of the book is an external presentation. We
know, that is, of Man Friday only what Crusoe could, according to
realistic appropriateness, tell us about him. We do not know what
he thought or felt within himself. On the other hand the method of
invisible narration had not at his time acquired the faculty which
it possesses now of doing Friday's thinking aloud or exposing fully
the workings of his mind. So that Richardson, whose interests were
psychological, whose strength and talent lay in the presentation of
the states of mind appropriate to situations of passion or
intrigue, had to look about him for a new form, and that form he
found in the novel of letters. In a way, if the end of a novel be
the presentation not of action, but of the springs of action; if
the external event is in it always of less importance than the
emotions which conditioned it, and the emotions which it set
working, the novel of letters is the supreme manner for fiction.
Consider the possibilities of it; there is a series of events in
which A, B, and C are concerned. Not only can the outward events be
narrated as they appeared to all three separately by means of
letters from each to another, or to a fourth party, but the motives
of each and the emotions which each experiences as a result of the
actions of the others or them all, can be laid bare. No other
method can wind itself so completely into the psychological
intricacies and recesses which lie behind every event. Yet the
form, as everybody knows, has not been popular; even an expert
novel-reader could hardly name off-hand more than two or three
examples of it since Richardson's day. Why is this? Well, chiefly
it is because the mass of novelists have not had Richardson's
knowledge of, or interest in, the psychological under side of life,
and those who have, as, amongst the moderns, Henry James, have
devised out of the convention of the invisible narrator a method by
which they can with greater economy attain in practice fairly good
results. For the mere narration of action in which the study of
character plays a subsidiary part, it was, of course, from the
beginning impossible. Scott turned aside at the height of his power
to try it in "Redgauntlet"; he never made a second attempt.</p>
<p>For Richardson's purpose, it answered admirably, and he used it
with supreme effect. Particularly he excelled in that side of the
novelist's craft which has ever since (whether because he started
it or not) proved the subtlest and most attractive, the
presentation of women. Richardson was one of those men who are not
at their ease in other men's society, and whom other men, to put it
plainly, are apt to regard as coxcombs and fools. But he had a
genius for the friendship and confidence of women. In his youth he
wrote love-letters for them. His first novel grew out of a plan to
exhibit in a series of letters the quality of feminine virtue, and
in its essence (though with a ludicrous, and so to speak
"kitchen-maidish" misunderstanding of his own sex) adheres to the
plan. His second novel, which designs to set up a model man against
the monster of iniquity in <cite>Pamela</cite>, is successful only
so far as it exhibits the thoughts and feelings of the heroine whom
he ultimately marries. His last, <cite>Clarissa Harlowe</cite> is a
masterpiece of sympathetic divination into the feminine mind.
<cite>Clarissa</cite> is, as has been well said, the "Eve of
fiction, the prototype of the modern heroine"; feminine psychology
as good as unknown before (Shakespeare's women being the "Fridays"
of a highly intelligent Crusoe) has hardly been brought further
since. But <cite>Clarissa</cite> is more than mere psychology;
whether she represents a contemporary tendency or whether
Richardson made her so, she starts a new epoch. "This," says
Henley, "is perhaps her finest virtue as it is certainly her
greatest charm; that until she set the example, woman in literature
as a self-suffering individuality, as an existence endowed with
equal rights to independence&mdash;of choice, volition,
action&mdash;with man had not begun to be." She had not begun to be
it in life either.</p>
<p>What Richardson did for the subtlest part of a novelist's
business, his dealings with psychology, Fielding did for the most
necessary part of it, the telling of the story. Before him hardly
any story had been told well; even if it had been plain and clear
as in Bunyan and Defoe it had lacked the emphasis, the light and
shade of skilful grouping. On the "picaresque" (so the
autobiographical form was called abroad) convention of a journey he
grafted a structure based in its outline on the form of the ancient
epic. It proved extraordinarily suitable for his purpose. Not only
did it make it easy for him to lighten his narrative with
excursions in a heightened style, burlesquing his origins, but it
gave him at once the right attitude to his material. He told his
story as one who knew everything; could tell conversations and
incidents as he conceived them happening, with no violation of
credibility, nor any strain on his reader's imagination, and
without any impropriety could interpose in his own person, pointing
things to the reader which might have escaped his attention,
pointing at parallels he might have missed, laying bare the irony
or humour beneath a situation. He allowed himself digressions and
episodes, told separate tales in the middle of the action,
introduced, as in Partridge's visit to the theatre, the added
piquancy of topical allusion; in fact he did anything he chose. And
he laid down that free form of the novel which is
characteristically English, and from which, in its essence, no one
till the modern realists has made a serious departure.</p>
<p>In the matter of his novels, he excels by reason of a
Shakespearean sense of character and by the richness and rightness
of his faculty of humour. He had a quick eye for contemporary
types, and an amazing power of building out of them men and women
whose individuality is full and rounded. You do not feel as you do
with Richardson that his fabric is spun silk-worm-wise out of
himself; on the contrary you know it to be the fruit of a gentle
and observant nature, and a stock of fundamental human sympathy.
His gallery of portraits, Joseph Andrews, Parson Adams, Parson
Trulliber, Jones, Blifil, Partridge, Sophia and her father and all
the rest are each of them minute studies of separate people; they
live and move according to their proper natures; they are conceived
not from without but from within. Both Richardson and Fielding were
conscious of a moral intention; but where Richardson is
sentimental, vulgar, and moral only so far as it is moral (as in
<cite>Pamela</cite>), to inculcate selling at the highest price or
(as in <cite>Grandison</cite>) to avoid temptations which never
come in your way, Fielding's morality is fresh and healthy, and
(though not quite free from the sentimentality of scoundrelism) at
bottom sane and true. His knowledge of the world kept him right.
His acquaintance with life is wide, and his insight is keen and
deep. His taste is almost as catholic as Shakespeare's own, and the
life he knew, and which other men knew, he handles for the first
time with the freedom and imagination of an artist.</p>
<p>Each of the two&mdash;Fielding and Richardson&mdash;had his host
of followers. Abroad Richardson won immediate recognition; in
France Diderot went so far as to compare him with Homer and Moses!
He gave the first impulse to modern French fiction. At home, less
happily, he set going the sentimental school, and it was only when
that had passed away that&mdash;in the delicate and subtle
character-study of Miss Austen&mdash;his influence comes to its
own. Miss Austen carried a step further, and with an observation
which was first hand and seconded by intuitive knowledge,
Richardson's analysis of the feminine mind, adding to it a delicate
and finely humorous feeling for character in both sexes which was
all her own. Fielding's imitators (they number each in his own way,
and with his own graces or talent added his rival Smollett, Sterne,
and Goldsmith) kept the way which leads to Thackeray and
Dickens&mdash;the main road of the English Novel.</p>
<p>That road was widened two ways by Sir Walter Scott. The
historical novel, which had been before his day either an essay in
anachronism with nothing historical in it but the date, or a
laborious and uninspired compilation of antiquarian research, took
form and life under his hands. His wide reading, stored as it was
in a marvellously retentive memory, gave him all the background he
needed to achieve a historical setting, and allowed him to
concentrate his attention on the actual telling of his story; to
which his genial and sympathetic humanity and his quick eye for
character gave a humorous depth and richness that was all his own.
It is not surprising that he made the historical novel a literary
vogue all over Europe. In the second place, he began in his novels
of Scottish character a sympathetic study of nationality. He is
not, perhaps, a fair guide to contemporary conditions; his
interests were too romantic and too much in the past to catch the
rattle of the looms that caught the ear of Galt, and if we want a
picture of the great fact of modern Scotland, its
industrialisation, it is to Galt we must go. But in his
comprehension of the essential character of the people he has no
rival; in it his historical sense seconded his observation, and the
two mingling gave us the pictures whose depth of colour and truth
make his Scottish novels, <cite>Old Mortality, The Antiquary,
Redgauntlet</cite>, the greatest things of their kind in
literature.</p>
<br>
<h4>(3)</h4>
<p>The peculiarly national style of fiction founded by Fielding and
carried on by his followers reached its culminating point in
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite>. In it the reader does not seem to be
simply present at the unfolding of a plot the end of which is
constantly present to the mind of the author and to which he is
always consciously working, every incident having a bearing on the
course of the action; rather he feels himself to be the spectator
of a piece of life which is too large and complex to be under the
control of a creator, which moves to its close not under the
impulsion of a directing hand, but independently impelled by causes
evolved in the course of its happening. With this added complexity
goes a more frequent interposition of the author in his own
person&mdash;one of the conventions as we have seen of this
national style. Thackeray is present to his readers, indeed, not as
the manager who pulls the strings and sets the puppets in motion,
but as an interpreter who directs the reader's attention to the
events on which he lays stress, and makes them a starting-point for
his own moralising. This persistent moralizing&mdash;sham cynical,
real sentimental&mdash;this thumping of death-bed pillows as in the
dreadful case of Miss Crawley, makes Thackeray's use of the
personal interposition almost less effective than that of any other
novelist. Already while he was doing it, Dickens had conquered the
public; and the English novel was making its second fresh
start.</p>
<p>He is an innovator in more ways than one. In the first place he
is the earliest novelist to practise a conscious artistry of plot.
<cite>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</cite> remains mysterious, but
those who essay to conjecture the end of that unfinished story have
at last the surety that its end, full worked out in all its
details, had been in its author's mind before he set pen to paper.
His imagination was as diligent and as disciplined as his pen,
Dickens' practice in this matter could not be better put than in
his own words, when he describes himself as "in the first stage of
a new book, which consists in going round and round the idea, as
you see a bird in his cage go about and about his sugar before he
touches it." That his plots are always highly elaborated is the
fruit of this preliminary disciplined exercise of thought. The
method is familiar to many novelists now; Dickens was the first to
put it into practice. In the second place he made a new departure
by his frankly admitted didacticism and by the skill with which in
all but two or three of his books&mdash;<cite>Bleak House</cite>,
perhaps, and <cite>Little Dorrit</cite>&mdash;he squared his
purpose with his art. Lastly he made the discovery which has made
him immortal. In him for the first time the English novel produced
an author who dug down into the masses of the people for his
subjects; apprehended them in all their inexhaustible character and
humour and pathos, and reproduced them with a lively and loving
artistic skill.</p>
<p>Dickens has, of course, serious faults. In particular, readers
emancipated by lapse of time from the enslavement of the first
enthusiasm, have quarrelled with the mawkishness and sentimentality
of his pathos, and with the exaggeration of his studies of
character. It has been said of him, as it has of Thackeray, that he
could not draw a "good woman" and that Agnes Copperfield, like
Amelia Sedley, is a very doll-like type of person. To critics of
this kind it may be retorted that though "good" and "bad" are
categories relevant to melodrama, they apply very ill to serious
fiction, and that indeed to the characters of any of the
novelists&mdash;the Bront&euml;s, Mrs. Gaskell or the
like&mdash;who lay bare character with fullness and intimacy, they
could not well be applied at all. The faultiness of them in Dickens
is less than in Thackeray, for in Dickens they are only incident to
the scheme, which lies in the hero (his heroes are excellent) and
in the grotesque characters, whereas in his rival they are in the
theme itself. For his pathos, not even his warmest admirer could
perhaps offer a satisfactory case. The charge of exaggeration
however is another matter. To the person who complains that he has
never met Dick Swiveller or Micawber or Mrs. Gamp the answer is
simply Turner's to the sceptical critic of his sunset, "Don't you
wish you could?" To the other, who objects more plausibly to
Dickens's habit of attaching to each of his characters some label
which is either so much flaunted all through that you cannot see
the character at all or else mysteriously and unaccountably
disappears when the story begins to grip the author, Dickens has
himself offered an amusing and convincing defence. In the preface
to <cite>Pickwick</cite> he answers those who criticised the novel
on the ground that Pickwick began by being purely ludicrous and
developed into a serious and sympathetic individuality, by pointing
to the analogous process which commonly takes place in actual human
relationships. You begin a new acquaintanceship with perhaps not
very charitable prepossessions; these later a deeper and better
knowledge removes, and where you have before seen an idiosyncrasy
you come to love a character. It is ingenious and it helps to
explain Mrs. Nickleby, the Pecksniff daughters, and many another.
Whether it is true or not (and it does not explain the faultiness
of such pictures as Carker and his kind) there can be no doubt that
this trick in Dickens of beginning with a salient impression and
working outward to a fuller conception of character is part at
least of the reason of his enormous hold upon his readers. No man
leads you into the mazes of his invention so easily and with such a
persuasive hand.</p>
<p>The great novelists who were writing contemporarily with
him&mdash;the Bront&euml;s, Mrs. Gaskell, George Eliot&mdash;it is
impossible to deal with here, except to say that the last is
indisputably, because of her inability to fuse completely art and
ethics, inferior to Mrs. Gaskell or to either of the Bront&euml;
sisters. Nor of the later Victorians who added fresh variety to the
national style can the greatest, Meredith, be more than mentioned
for the exquisiteness of his comic spirit and the brave gallery of
English men and women he has given us in what is, perhaps,
fundamentally the most English thing in fiction since Fielding
wrote. For our purpose Mr. Hardy, though he is a less brilliant
artist, is more to the point. His novels brought into England the
contemporary pessimism of Schopenhaur and the Russians, and found a
home for it among the English peasantry. Convinced that in the
upper classes character could be studied and portrayed only
subjectively because of the artificiality of a society which
prevented its outlet in action, he turned to the peasantry because
with them conduct is the direct expression of the inner life.
Character could be shown working, therefore, not subjectively but
in the act, if you chose a peasant subject. His philosophy,
expressed in this medium, is sombre. In his novels you can trace a
gradual realization of the defects of natural laws and the quandary
men are put to by their operation. Chance, an irritating and
trifling series of coincidences, plays the part of fate. Nature
seems to enter with the hopelessness of man's mood. Finally the
novelist turns against life itself. "Birth," he says, speaking of
Tess, "seemed to her an ordeal of degrading personal compulsion
whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to justify and at
best could only palliate." It is strange to find pessimism in a
romantic setting; strange, too, to find a paganism which is so
little capable of light or joy.</p>
<br>
<h4>(4)</h4>
<p>The characteristic form of English fiction, that in which the
requisite illusion of the complexity and variety of life is
rendered by discursiveness, by an author's licence to digress, to
double back on himself, to start may be in the middle of a story
and work subsequently to the beginning and the end; in short by his
power to do whatever is most expressive of his individuality, found
a rival in the last twenty years of the nineteenth century in the
French Naturalistic or Realist school, in which the illusion of
life is got by a studied and sober veracity of statement, and by
the minute accumulation of detail. To the French Naturalists a
novel approached in importance the work of a man of science, and
they believed it ought to be based on documentary evidence, as a
scientific work would be. Above all it ought not to allow itself to
be coloured by the least gloss of imagination or idealism; it ought
never to shrink from a confrontation of the naked fact. On the
contrary it was its business to carry it to the dissecting table
and there minutely examine everything that lay beneath its
surface.</p>
<p>The school first became an English possession in the early
translations of the work of Zola; its methods were transplanted
into English fiction by Mr. George Moore. From his novels, both in
passages of direct statement and in the light of his practice, it
is possible to gather together the materials of a manifesto of the
English Naturalistic school. The naturalists complained that
English fiction lacked construction in the strictest sense; they
found in the English novel a remarkable absence of organic
wholeness; it did not fulfil their first and broadest canon of
subject-matter&mdash;by which a novel has to deal in the first
place with a single and rhythmical series of events; it was too
discursive. They made this charge against English fiction; they
also retorted the charge brought by native writers and their
readers against the French of foulness, sordidness and pessimism in
their view of life. "We do not," says a novelist in one of Mr.
Moore's books, "we do not always choose what you call unpleasant
subjects, but we do try to get to the roots of things; and the
basis of life being material and not spiritual, the analyst sooner
or later finds himself invariably handling what this sentimental
age calls coarse." "The novel," says the same character, "if it be
anything is contemporary history, an exact and complete
reproduction of the social surroundings of the age we live in."
That succinctly is the naturalistic theory of the novel as a work
of science&mdash;that as the history of a nation lies hidden often
in social wrongs and in domestic grief as much as in the movements
of parties or dynasties, the novelist must do for the former what
the historian does for the latter. It is his business in the scheme
of knowledge of his time.</p>
<p>But the naturalists believed quite as profoundly in the novel as
a work of art. They claimed for their careful pictures of the grey
and sad and sordid an artistic worth, varying in proportion to the
intensity of the emotion in which the picture was composed and
according to the picture's truth, but in its essence just as real
and permanent as the artistic worth of romance. "Seen from afar,"
writes Mr. Moore, "all things in nature are of equal worth; and the
meanest things, when viewed with the eyes of God, are raised to
heights of tragic awe which conventionality would limit to the
deaths of kings and patriots." On such a lofty theory they built
their treatment and their style. It is a mistake to suppose that
the realist school deliberately cultivates the sordid or shocking.
Examine in this connection Mr. Moore's <cite>Mummer's Wife</cite>,
our greatest English realist novel, and for the matter of that one
of the supreme things in English fiction, and you will see that the
scrupulous fidelity of the author's method, though it denies him
those concessions to a sentimentalist or romantic view of life
which are the common implements of fiction, denies him no less the
extremities of horror or loathsomeness. The heroine sinks into the
miserable squalor of a dipsomaniac and dies from a drunkard's
disease, but her end is shown as the ineluctable consequence of her
life, its early greyness and monotony, the sudden shock of a new
and strange environment and the resultant weakness of will which a
morbid excitability inevitably brought about. The novel, that is to
say, deals with a "rhythmical series of events and follows them to
their conclusion"; it gets at the roots of things; it tells us of
something which we know to be true in life whether we care to read
it in fiction or not. There is nothing in it of sordidness for
sordidness' sake nor have the realists any philosophy of an unhappy
ending. In this case the ending is unhappy because the sequence of
events admitted of no other solution; in others the ending is happy
or merely neutral as the preceding story decides. If what one may
call neutral endings predominate, it is because they
also&mdash;notoriously&mdash;predominate in life. But the question
of unhappiness or its opposite has nothing whatever to do with the
larger matter of beauty; it is the triumph of the realists that at
their best they discovered a new beauty in things, the loveliness
that lies in obscure places, the splendour of sordidness, humility,
and pain. They have taught us that beauty, like the Spirit, blows
where it lists and we know from them that the antithesis between
realism and idealism is only on their lower levels; at their
summits they unite and are one. No true realist but is an idealist
too.</p>
<p>Most of what is best in English fiction since has been directly
occasioned by their work; Gissing and Mr. Arnold Bennett may be
mentioned as two authors who are fundamentally realist in their
conception of the art of the novel, and the realist ideal partakes
in a greater or less degree in the work of nearly all our eminent
novelists to-day. But realism is not and cannot be interesting to
the great public; it portrays people as they are, not as they would
like to be, and where they are, not where they would like to be. It
gives no background for day-dreaming. Now literature (to repeat
what has been than more once stated earlier in this book) is a way
of escape from life as well as an echo or mirror of it, and the
novel as the form of literature which more than any other men read
for pleasure, is the main avenue for this escape. So that alongside
this invasion of realism it is not strange that there grew a
revival in romance.</p>
<p>The main agent of it, Robert Louis Stevenson, had the romantic
strain in him intensified by the conditions under which he worked;
a weak and anaemic man, he loved bloodshed as a cripple loves
athletics&mdash;passionately and with the intimate enthusiasm of
make-believe which an imaginative man can bring to bear on the
contemplation of what can never be his. His natural attraction for
"redness and juice" in life was seconded by a delightful and
fantastic sense of the boundless possibilities of romance in
every-day things. To a realist a hansom-cab driver is a man who
makes twenty-five shillings a week, lives in a back street in
Pimlico, has a wife who drinks and children who grow up with an
alcoholic taint; the realist will compare his lot with other
cab-drivers, and find what part of his life is the product of the
cab-driving environment, and on that basis he will write his book.
To Stevenson and to the romanticist generally, a hansom cab-driver
is a mystery behind whose apparent commonplaceness lie magic
possibilities beyond all telling; not one but may be the agent of
the Prince of Bohemia, ready to drive you off to some mad and magic
adventure in a street which is just as commonplace to the outward
eye as the cab-driver himself, but which implicates by its very
deceitful commonness whole volumes of romance. The novel-reader to
whom <cite>Demos</cite> was the repetition of what he had seen and
known, and what had planted sickness in his soul, found the
<cite>New Arabian Nights</cite> a refreshing miracle. Stevenson had
discovered that modern London had its possibilities of romance. To
these two elements of his romantic equipment must be added a
third&mdash;travel. Defoe never left England, and other early
romanticists less gifted with invention than he wrote from the
mind's eye and from books. To Stevenson, and to his successor Mr.
Kipling, whose "discovery" of India is one of the salient facts of
modern English letters, and to Mr. Conrad belongs the credit of
teaching novelists to draw on experience for the scenes they seek
to present. A fourth element in the equipment of modern
romanticism&mdash;that which draws its effects from the "miracles"
of modern science, has been added since by Mr. H. G. Wells, in
whose latest work the realistic and romantic schools seem to have
united.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<br>
<h3>THE PRESENT AGE</h3>
<p>We have carried our study down to the death of Ruskin and
included in it authors like Swinburne and Meredith who survived
till recently; and in discussing the novel we have included men
like Kipling and Hardy&mdash;living authors. It would be possible
and perhaps safer to stop there and make no attempt to bring
writers later than these into our survey. To do so is to court an
easily and quickly stated objection. One is anticipating the
verdict of posterity. How can we who are contemporaries tell
whether an author's work is permanent or no?</p>
<p>Of course, in a sense the point of view expressed by these
questions is true enough. It is always idle to anticipate the
verdict of posterity. Remember Matthew Arnold's prophecy that at
the end of the nineteenth century Wordsworth and Byron would be the
two great names in Romantic poetry. We are ten years and more past
that date now, and so far as Byron is concerned, at any rate, there
is no sign that Arnold's prediction has come true. But the obvious
fact that we cannot do our grandchildren's thinking for them, is no
reason why we should refuse to think for ourselves. No notion is so
destructive to the formation of a sound literary taste as the
notion that books become literature only when their authors are
dead. Round us men and women are putting into plays and poetry and
novels the best that they can or know. They are writing not for a
dim and uncertain future but for us, and on our recognition and
welcome they depend, sometimes for their livelihood, always for the
courage which carries them on to fresh endeavour. Literature is an
ever-living and continuous thing, and we do it less than its due
service if we are so occupied reading Shakespeare and Milton and
Scott that we have no time to read Mr. Yeats, Mr. Shaw or Mr.
Wells. Students of literature must remember that classics are being
manufactured daily under their eyes, and that on their sympathy and
comprehension depends whether an author receives the success he
merits when he is alive to enjoy it.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter, then, is to draw a rough picture of
some of the lines or schools of contemporary writing&mdash;of the
writing mainly, though not altogether, of living authors. It is
intended to indicate some characteristics of the general trend or
drift of literary effort as a whole. The most remarkable feature of
the age, as far as writing is concerned, is without doubt its
inattention to poetry. Tennyson was a popular author; his books
sold in thousands; his lines passed into that common conversational
currency of unconscious quotation which is the surest testimony to
the permeation of a poet's influence. Even Browning, though his
popularity came late, found himself carried into all the nooks and
corners of the reading public. His robust and masculine morality,
understood at last, or expounded by a semi-priestly class of
interpreters, made him popular with those readers&mdash;and they
are the majority&mdash;who love their reading to convey a moral
lesson, just as Tennyson's reflection of his time's distraction
between science and religion endeared them to those who found in
him an answer or at least an echo to their own perplexities. A work
widely different from either of these, Fitzgerald's <cite>Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam</cite>, shared and has probably exceeded their
popularity for similar reasons. Its easy pessimism and cult of
pleasure, its delightful freedom from any demand for continuous
thought from its readers, its appeal to the indolence and moral
flaccidity which is implicit in all men, all contributed to its
immense vogue; and among people who perhaps did not fully
understand it but were merely lulled by its sonorousness, a
knowledge of it has passed for the insignia of a love of literature
and the possession of literary taste. But after
Fitzgerald&mdash;who? What poet has commanded the ear of the
reading public or even a fraction of it? Not Swinburne certainly,
partly because of his undoubted difficulty, partly because of a
suspicion held of his moral and religious tenets, largely from
material reasons quite unconnected with the quality of his work;
not Morris, nor his followers; none of the so-called minor poets
whom we shall notice presently&mdash;poets who have drawn the moods
that have nourished their work from the decadents of France.
Probably the only writer of verse who is at the same time a poet
and has acquired a large popularity and public influence is Mr.
Kipling. His work as a novelist we mentioned in the last chapter.
It remains to say something of his achievements in verse.</p>
<p>Let us grant at once his faults. He can be violent, and
over-rhetorical; he belabours you with sense impressions, and with
the polysyllabic rhetoric he learned from Swinburne&mdash;and
(though this is not the place for a discussion of political ideas)
he can offend by the sentimental brutalism which too often passes
for patriotism in his poetry. Not that this last represents the
total impression of his attitude as an Englishman. His later work
in poetry and prose, devoted to the reconstruction of English
history, is remarkable for the justness and saneness of its temper.
There are other faults&mdash;a lack of sureness in taste is
one&mdash;that could be mentioned but they do not affect the main
greatness of his work. He is great because he discovered a new
subject-matter, and because of the white heat of imagination which
in his best things he brought to bear on it and by which he
transposed it into poetry. It is Mr. Kipling's special distinction
that the apparatus of modern civilization&mdash;steam engines, and
steamships, and telegraph lines, and the art of flight&mdash;take
on in his hands a poetic quality as authentic and inspiring as any
that ever was cast over the implements of other and what the mass
of men believe to have been more picturesque days. Romance is in
the present, so he teaches us, not in the past, and we do it wrong
to leave it only the territory we have ourselves discarded in the
advance of the race. That and the great discovery of India&mdash;an
India misunderstood for his own purposes no doubt, but still the
first presentiment of an essential fact in our modern history as a
people&mdash;give him the hold that he has, and rightly, over the
minds of his readers.</p>
<p>It is in a territory poles apart from Mr. Kipling's that the
main stream of romantic poetry flows. Apart from the gravely
delicate and scholarly work of Mr. Bridges, and the poetry of some
others who work separately away from their fellows, English
romantic poetry has concentrated itself into one chief
school&mdash;the school of the "Celtic Revival" of which the leader
is Mr. W.B. Yeats. Two sources went to its making. In its
inception, it arose out of a group of young poets who worked in a
conscious imitation of the methods of the French decadents; chiefly
of Baudelaire and Verlaine. As a whole their work was merely
imitative and not very profound, but each of them&mdash;Ernest
Dowson and Lionel Johnson, who are both now dead, and others who
are still living&mdash;produced enough to show that they had at
their command a vein of poetry that might have deepened and proved
more rich had they gone on working it. One of them, Mr. W.B. Yeats,
by his birth and his reading in Irish legend and folklore, became
possessed of a subject-matter denied to his fellows, and it is from
the combination of the mood of the decadents with the dreaminess
and mystery of Celtic tradition and romance&mdash;a combination
which came to pass in his poetry&mdash;that the Celtic school has
sprung. In a sense it has added to the territory explored by
Coleridge and Scott and Morris a new province. Only nothing could
be further from the objectivity of these men, than the way in which
the Celtic school approaches its material. Its stories are clear to
itself, it may be, but not to its readers. Deirdre and Conchubar,
and Angus and Maeve and Dectora and all the shadowy figures in them
scarcely become embodied. Their lives and deaths and loves and
hates are only a scheme on which they weave a delicate and dim
embroidery of pure poetry&mdash;of love and death and old age and
the passing of beauty and all the sorrows that have been since the
world began and will be till the world ends. If Mr. Kipling is of
the earth earthy, if the clangour and rush of the world is in
everything he writes, Mr. Yeats and his school live consciously
sequestered and withdrawn, and the world never breaks in on their
ghostly troubles or their peace. Poetry never fails to relate
itself to its age; if it is not with it, it is against it; it is
never merely indifferent. The poetry of these men is the denial,
passionately made, of everything the world prizes. While such a
denial is sincere, as in the best of them, then the verses they
make are true and fine. But when it is assumed, as in some of their
imitators, then the work they did is not true poetry.</p>
<p>But the literary characteristic of the present age&mdash;the one
which is most likely to differentiate it from its predecessor, is
the revival of the drama. When we left it before the Commonwealth
the great English literary school of playwriting&mdash;the romantic
drama&mdash;was already dead. It has had since no second birth.
There followed after it the heroic tragedy of Dryden and
Shadwell&mdash;a turgid, declamatory form of art without
importance&mdash;and two brilliant comic periods, the earlier and
greater that of Congreve and Wycherley, the later more sentimental
with less art and vivacity, that of Goldsmith and Sheridan. With
Sheridan the drama as a literary force died a second time. It has
been born again only in our own day. It is, of course, unnecessary
to point out that the writing of plays did not cease in the
interval; it never does cease. The production of dramatic
journey-work has been continuous since the re-opening of the
theatres in 1660, and it is carried on as plentifully as ever at
this present time. Only side by side with it there has grown up a
new literary drama, and gradually the main stream of artistic
endeavour which for nearly a century has preoccupied itself with
the novel almost to the exclusion of other forms of art, has turned
back to the stage as its channel to articulation and an audience.
An influence from abroad set it in motion. The plays of
Ibsen&mdash;produced, the best of them, in the eighties of last
century&mdash;came to England in the nineties. In a way, perhaps,
they were misunderstood by their worshippers hardly less than by
their enemies, but all excrescences of enthusiasm apart they taught
men a new and freer approach to moral questions, and a new and
freer dramatic technique. Where plays had been constructed on a
journeyman plan evolved by Labiche and Sardou&mdash;mid-nineteenth
century writers in France&mdash;a plan delighting in symmetry,
close-jointedness, false correspondences, an impossible use of
coincidence, and a quite unreal complexity and elaboration, they
become bolder and less artificial, more close to the likelihoods of
real life. The gravity of the problems with which they set
themselves to deal heightened their influence. In England men began
to ask themselves whether the theatre here too could not be made an
avenue towards the discussion of living difficulties, and then
arose the new school of dramatists&mdash;of whom the first and most
remarkable is Mr. George Bernard Shaw. In his earlier plays he set
himself boldly to attack established conventions, and to ask his
audiences to think for themselves. <cite>Arms and the Man</cite>
dealt a blow at the cheap romanticism with which a peace-living
public invests the profession of arms; <cite>The Devil's
Disciple</cite> was a shrewd criticism of the preposterous
self-sacrifice on which melodrama, which is the most popular
non-literary form of play-writing, is commonly based; <cite>Mrs.
Warren's Profession</cite> made a brave and plain-spoken attempt to
drag the public face to face with the nauseous realities of
prostitution; <cite>Widowers' Houses</cite> laid bare the
sordidness of a Society which bases itself on the exploitation of
the poor for the luxuries of the rich. It took Mr. Shaw close on
ten years to persuade even the moderate number of men and women who
make up a theatre audience that his plays were worth listening to.
But before his final success came he had attained a substantial
popularity with the public which reads. Possibly his early failure
on the stage&mdash;mainly due to the obstinacy of playgoers
immersed in a stock tradition&mdash;was partly due also to his
failure in constructive power. He is an adept at tying knots and
impatient of unravelling them; his third acts are apt either to
evaporate in talk or to find some unreal and unsatisfactory
solution for the complexity he has created. But constructive
weakness apart, his amazing brilliance and fecundity of dialogue
ought to have given him an immediate and lasting grip of the stage.
There has probably never been a dramatist who could invest
conversation with the same vivacity and point, the same combination
of surprise and inevitableness that distinguishes his best
work.</p>
<p>Alongside of Mr. Shaw more immediately successful, and not
traceable to any obvious influence, English or foreign, came the
comedies of Oscar Wilde. For a parallel to their pure delight and
high spirits, and to the exquisite wit and artifice with which they
were constructed, one would have to go back to the dramatists of
the Restoration. To Congreve and his school, indeed, Wilde belongs
rather than to any later period. With his own age he had little in
common; he was without interest in its social and moral problems;
when he approved of socialism it was because in a socialist state
the artist might be absolved from the necessity of carrying a
living, and be free to follow his art undisturbed. He loved to
think of himself as symbolic, but all he symbolized was a fantasy
of his own creating; his attitude to his age was decorative and
withdrawn rather than representative. He was the licensed jester to
society, and in that capacity he gave us his plays. Mr. Shaw may be
said to have founded a school; at any rate he gave the start to Mr.
Galsworthy and some lesser dramatists. Wilde founded nothing, and
his works remain as complete and separate as those of the earlier
artificial dramatists of two centuries before.</p>
<p>Another school of drama, homogeneous and quite apart from the
rest, remains. We have seen how the "Celtic Revival," as the Irish
literary movement has been called by its admirers, gave us a new
kind of romantic poetry. As an offshoot from it there came into
being some ten years ago an Irish school of drama, drawing its
inspiration from two sources&mdash;the body of the old Irish
legends and the highly individualized and richly-coloured life of
the Irish peasants in the mountains of Wicklow and of the West, a
life, so the dramatists believed, still unspoiled by the deepening
influences of a false system of education and the wear and tear of
a civilization whose values are commercial and not spiritual or
artistic. The school founded its own theatre, trained its own
actors, fashioned its own modes of speech (the chief of which was a
frank restoration of rhythm in the speaking of verse and of cadence
in prose), and having all these things it produced a series of
plays all directed to its special ends, and all composed and
written with a special fidelity to country life as it has been
preserved, or to what it conceived to be the spirit of Irish
folk-legend. It reached its zenith quickly, and as far as the
production of plays is concerned, it would seem to be already in
its decline. That is to say, what in the beginning was a fresh and
vivid inspiration caught direct from life has become a pattern
whose colours and shape can be repeated or varied by lesser writers
who take their teaching from the original discoverers. But in the
course of its brief and striking course it produced one great
dramatist&mdash;a writer whom already not three years after his
death, men instinctively class with the masters of his art.</p>
<p>J.M. Synge, in the earlier years of his manhood, lived entirely
abroad, leading the life of a wandering scholar from city to city
and country to country till he was persuaded to give up the
Continent and the criticism and imitation of French literature, to
return to England, and to go and live on the Aran Islands. From
that time till his death&mdash;some ten years&mdash;he spent a
large part of each year amongst the peasantry of the desolate
Atlantic coast and wrote the plays by which his name is known. His
literary output was not large, but he supplied the Irish dramatic
movement with exactly what it needed&mdash;a vivid contact with the
realities of life. Not that he was a mere student or transcriber of
manners. His wandering life among many peoples and his study of
classical French and German literature had equipped him as perhaps
no other modern dramatist has been equipped with an imaginative
insight and a reach of perception which enabled him to give
universality and depth to his pourtrayal of the peasant types
around him. He got down to the great elemental forces which throb
and pulse beneath the common crises of everyday life and laid them
bare, not as ugly and horrible, but with a sense of their terror,
their beauty and their strength. His earliest play, <cite>The Well
of the Saints</cite>, treats of a sorrow that is as old as Helen of
the vanishing of beauty and the irony of fulfilled desire. The
great realities of death pass through the <cite>Riders to the
Sea</cite>, till the language takes on a kind of simplicity as of
written words shrivelling up in a flame. <cite>The Playboy of the
Western World</cite> is a study of character, terrible in its
clarity, but never losing the savour of imagination and of the
astringency and saltness that was characteristic of his temper. He
had at his command an instrument of incomparable fineness and range
in the language which he fashioned out the speech of the common
people amongst whom he lived. In his dramatic writings this
language took on a kind of rhythm which had the effect of producing
a certain remoteness of the highest possible artistic value. The
people of his imagination appear a little disembodied. They talk
with that straightforward and simple kind of innocency which makes
strange and impressive the dialogue of Maeterlinck's earlier plays.
Through it, as Mr. Yeats has said, he saw the subject-matter of his
art "with wise, clear-seeing, unreflecting eyes&mdash;and he
preserved the innocence of good art in an age of reasons and
purposes." He had no theory except of his art; no "ideas" and no
"problems"; he did not wish to change anything or to reform
anything; but he saw all his people pass by as before a window, and
he heard their words. This resolute refusal to be interested in or
to take account of current modes of thought has been considered by
some to detract from his eminence. Certainly if by "ideas" we mean
current views on society or morality, he is deficient in them; only
his very deficiency brings him nearer to the great masters of
drama&mdash;to Ben Johnson, to Cervantes, to
Moli&egrave;re&mdash;even to Shakespeare himself. Probably in no
single case amongst our contemporaries could a high and permanent
place in literature be prophesied with more confidence than in
his.</p>
<p>In the past it has seemed impossible for fiction and the drama,
i.e. serious drama of high literary quality, to flourish, side by
side. It seems as though the best creative minds in any age could
find strength for any one of these two great outlets for the
activity of the creative imagination. In the reign of Elizabeth the
drama outshone fiction; in the reign of Victoria the novel crowded
out the drama. There are signs that a literary era is commencing,
in which the drama will again regain to the full its position as a
literature. More and more the bigger creative artists will turn to
a form which by its economy of means to ends, and the chance it
gives not merely of observing but of creating and displaying
character in action, has a more vigorous principle of life in it
than its rival.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>It is best to study English literature one period, or, even in
the case of the greatest, one author at a time. In every case the
student should see to it that he knows the <em>text</em> of his
authors; a knowledge of what critics have said about our poets is a
poor substitute for a knowledge of what they have said themselves.
Poetry ought to be read slowly and carefully, and the reader ought
to pay his author the compliment of crediting him with ideas as
important and, on occasion, as abstruse as any in a work of
philosophy or abstract science. When the meaning is mastered, the
poem ought to be read a second time aloud to catch the magic of the
language and the verse. The reading of prose presents less
difficulty, but there again the rule is, never allow yourself to be
lulled by sound. Reading is an intellectual and not an hypnotic
exercise.</p>
<p>The following short bibliography is divided to correspond with

Produced by Cera Kruger and PG Distributed Proofreaders

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.

     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
